        <title>Confederate Monuments in Wyman Park Dell</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: These tour notes were prepared by Eli Pousson in November 2015 for a Baltimore Heritage tour and discussion program organized on December 5, 2015 in advance of a public meeting on December 15, 2015 by the Special Commission to Review Baltimore’s Public Confederate Monuments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a walk around Wyman Park Dell and Charles Village to learn about ongoing review of Baltimore’s public Confederate monuments, the history behind these statues, and the complicated issue of public memory and public art. This tour is intended to create a safe place for learning and discussion about both Confederate and Union monuments and their meaning in the past and present. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreplanning.wix.com/monumentcommission&quot;&gt;Commission to Review Baltimore’s Public Confederate Monuments&lt;/a&gt; is currently developing recommendations for the treatment of four Confederate monuments located on city property. The Committee will hold its final &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.org/event/public-hearing-special-commission-to-review-baltimores-public-confederate-monuments/&quot;&gt;hearing on December 15&lt;/a&gt;, and this tour is a good opportunity to learn more about the monuments and reflect on your own views ahead of time. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/baltimore-civil-rights-heritage/confederate-memory/&quot;&gt;read a working draft of the Baltimore Heritage study&lt;/a&gt; of these monuments here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This program is free but participants are welcome to make an optional $5 donation to support our work. We are trying to arrange for warm refreshments following the walk and allow further time for questions and discussion. Stay tuned for details! For questions, please contact Eli Pousson at 301-204-3337.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we going to see today?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Union Soldier’s and Sailors Monument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins University Campus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Johns Hopkins Bust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidney Lanier Monument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confederate Women’s Monument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lee-Jackson Monument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Quincy Adams said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Democracy has no monuments. It strikes no medals. It bears the head of no man on a coin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Shackel asks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Should local, state, and national parks continue to support a memory of the era in which historic sites were created—in the name of American heritage—or should these sites be seen as dynamic, fluid, and changing places that serve the needs of contemporary society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Leff (1995) on why people critique “revisionist” history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This epithet, “revisionist,” … may be the key to understanding the current crisis of history. “Revisionist” meant the displacement of the more happy-faced, elite oriented view of American progress and destiny to which most Americans, particularly those raised on “consensus history” textbooks, had became accustomed. At the same time, the use of “revisionist” as a term of abuse suggests a reaction of the very notion of historical reinterpretation, under the assumption that the displaced version of history had been objective and factual, while the revisions were subjective and faddish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;union-soldiers-and-sailors-monument&quot;&gt;Union Soldier’s and Sailors Monument&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dates: dedicated 1909, moved 1959&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creator:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location: N. Charles Street&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dimensions:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Material:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 5, 1906&lt;/strong&gt;: Maryland State legislature authorized funding for the construction of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Soldiers_and_Sailors_Monument&quot;&gt;Union Soldiers and Sailors Monument&lt;/a&gt;in Baltimore. Likely a reaction to the installation of the Confederate monument on Mount Royal in 1903.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 6, 1909&lt;/strong&gt;: Monument dedicated in Druid Hill Park&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1959&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore relocated the monument to Wyman Park Dell to make way for the construction of the Jones Falls Expressway through Druid Hill Park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plans for the monument prompted a striking response from a number of opponents including one woman who sent a series of letters to the Sun (signing them “A Maryland Woman”). The first letter, published on June 19, 1906 stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”The State erected no monument to her Colonial or Revolutionary heroes. No marble tells of their deeds, raised at the expense of the taxpayers. Why, then, should one go up to a motley throng of negroes and aliens. Look at their pension lists and see.
By what right did the Legislature of 1906 pass a bill giving the people’s money, or the Governor sign it, for such a purpose? Erect a monument to what? Considering who composed the Maryland Federals, no wonder the State Treasury had to furnish the money. We pay taxes for their pensions, without objection, but to be forced to pay to give them a monument is past endurance. […] As the last General Assembly and Governor Warfield compel us to pay $25,000 to erect a monument, we ask the favor to be allowed to present a design, hoping to make it tell true history. I do not think I make a mistake in saying that the majority of native-born who wore the blue at that period were negroes. Certainly, they gathered by the hordes in camps through Southern Maryland. I would suggest this monument be a block of ebony on a base of tar, and a master hand wield the chisel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After describing a series of racist scenes for the monument, the letter claimed that the legislature had proposed a monument to “oppression and negro insolence, forcing contribulations [sic] from us, the descendants of Southern men and women, who had the courage of their convictions and never faltered in loyalty or love, but were supreme in both.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the letter met with equally strong responses and critiques, “A Maryland Woman” wrote back in a letter published on June 23, 1906:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The act to take $25,000 from the State Treasury to erect a monument to the soldiers of Maryland does not say “to the white,” etc.—it could not discriminate. How will you eliminate the soldier negroes? Will you say to them, Because you are negroes this monument is not for you? You cannot refuse them full recognition on it, a place at every ceremony and full share in the orators’ glowing eloquence. You must accept your negro companion in arms. He wore the blue and carried a gun. I think all fair minds will say that this monument represents his services equally with yours. This is the inevitable result of asking the State to pay for it. Had you, who wish to honor your dead, erected it at your own expense and by your own exertions, you could have a white monument, with names of white comrades carved on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on July 17, 1906, “A Maryland Woman” again responds again to critics, writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Yes, there stands another monument here, erected by the efforts and the work of the Southern women of Maryland, with loving hearts and willing hands, but not one cent of the State’s funds was asked or received. It stands, white, as stainless as the lives, as pure as the souls of our dear dead heroes—our &lt;em&gt;gloria victis&lt;/em&gt; to the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;johns-hopkins-bust&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins Bust&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dates: Dedicated 1935, moved 1955&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location: N. Charles and E. 33rd Streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dimensions: 19 feet tall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Material: Bronze and marble&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sculptor&lt;/em&gt;: Hans Schuler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1873&lt;/strong&gt;: Johns Hopkins dies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1875&lt;/strong&gt;: University established in his name&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1935&lt;/strong&gt;: Erected at N. Charles and E. 34th Streets [Who came?]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1952&lt;/strong&gt;: 2 firefighters killed, 6 injured when fire trucks racing to a dormitory mattress fire collided, their view obstructed by the monument&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1955&lt;/strong&gt;: After 3 years, JHU and Baltimore City agree on a new site (JHU opposed a plan to locate monument on what is now “the Beach”) at N. Charles and E. 33rd Streets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;/strong&gt;: San Martin Center built, changing the backdrop from a wooded glade to spare brick walls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the bust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Hopkins monument features a portrait bust of the philanthropist looking out from atop a marble pylon. On the north side of the base, a female figure holding a bowl, a serpent encircling her arm, represents healing and the hospital; on the south side, a contemplative male figure with a book and a scroll represents knowledge and the university. A fountain in front of the monument is a metaphor for the continuing impact of Hopkins’ $7 million gift to Baltimore.
According to Hopkins Magazine, critics initially complained about the art (too few clothes on the allegorical figures at the base) and safety (fish ponds called for in the plans were deemed a danger to small children and never built).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Hans Schuler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hans Schuler (1874-1951) was a noted Baltimore monument maker whose works include Hopkins University’s Sidney Lanier and a statue of President James Buchanan in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Johns Hopkins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A Quaker from a plantation in Virginia, Hopkins and his brothers first business was selling supplies from covered wagons in the Shenandoah Valley. Occasionally they traded goods for corn whiskey, repackaged the liquor, and sold it to Baltimoreans as Hopkins Best. After a series of businesses Hopkins eventually helped bankroll the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad during the company’s westward expansion, bailing the company out of debt several times and making himself a very wealthy man in the process. During and after the Civil War, Hopkins thrived as an investor and professional, becoming one of the richest men in American history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;confederate-womens-monument&quot;&gt;Confederate Women’s Monument&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dates:1916&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creator: J. Maxwell Miller&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location: N. Charles and University Parkway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dimensions:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Material:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the monument&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Donated by the State of Maryland, this monument is by J. Maxwell Miller, the artist behind the Star-Spangled Banner Centennial Monument. The memorial depicts two stoic women, one of whom is standing looking off into the distance, while the other kneels down clutching the body of a fallen soldier who has dropped his flag. The inscription reads, “In difficulty and danger, regardless of self, they fed the hungry, clothed the needy, nursed the wounded and comforted the dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1914&lt;/strong&gt;: General Assembly of Maryland approved a bill entitled “An act to erect a suitable monument in the city of Baltimore to commemorate the heroism, devotion and self-sacrifice of the women of Maryland in their service to the wounded Confederate soldiers who came under their care in the war between the States—1861-1865.” The act appropriated $12,000 in state funding and a large number of private contributions to “The Maryland Confederate Women’s Monument Fund”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2, 1916&lt;/strong&gt;: Confederate Women’s Monument dedicated on University Parkway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 18, 1919&lt;/strong&gt;: United Daughters of the Confederacy incorporated in Washington, DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 28, 1916, the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”The unveiling ceremonies will be conducted by the Rev. William M. Dame, D.D. and the orator of the day will be James McC. Trippe, whose daughter, Miss Mary Ringgold Trippe, will unveil the monument at the close of the oration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 3, the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; continued with an account of the unveiling ceremonies (“braving the cutting wind”) attended by a “crowd of several hundred persons, composed of former supporters of the Confederacy, their friends and descendants,” noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”The monument, which is the work of J. Maxwell Miller and represents a mother holding a dying hero in her arms, in front of a figure typifying the devoted women of the Confederacy, was veiled with the Stars and Stripes and the Stars and Bars, both being drawn aside by Miss Mary Ringgold Trippe, grand-daughter of the late Gen. Anew C. Trippe, chairman of the monument commission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 1946, the Sun published a light feature by Amy Grief suggests the popular perception of Confederate monuments may have been changing, writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“So you drive out Charles street, turn the car at University parkway to face south start with specimen No. 1 — that “Confederate Women of Maryland” price, “The Brave at Home.” It has been there many years, but you’ve never noticed it. It’s not particularly distinguished, not bad—simply a part of the landscape you’ve accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sidney-lanier-monument&quot;&gt;Sidney Lanier Monument&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dates: Dedicated 1942&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location: Charles Street near University Parkway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dimensions: almost 9 feet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Material: Bronze and unpolished granite boulders&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1881&lt;/strong&gt;: Sidney Lanier dies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1941&lt;/strong&gt;: Monument cast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1942&lt;/strong&gt;: Monument to Lanier, designed by Hans Scholar, dedicated in his honor (2/3/42 – centenary of Lanier’s birth), gift of the Baltimore Municipal Art Society&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the monument&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The sculpture shows the tall Southerner in repose, holding a pencil and journal, with coat, hat, flute, and sheet music by his side. His gaunt face is framed by an allegorical bas relief with trees and marsh. The sun on the horizon makes a visual reference to a line from his last completed poem, “Sunrise”: “I am lit with the Sun,” which is also the inscription on his grave at Baltimore’s Green Mount Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cindy Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;: “Visually it is so beautiful and so unusual, but when you learn about the man, it makes the statue so poignant,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Sidney Lanier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The monument Hans Schuler created of Sidney Lanier shows him at rest in a bucolic setting, an idealized view of a man who wanted only to pursue his art but struggled mightily to achieve his goals. … widely acclaimed Southern poet of the post-Civil War period (famous poems include “The Marshes of Glynn” and “Songs of the Chattahoochee”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1842&lt;/strong&gt;: Sidney Lanier is born&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1861&lt;/strong&gt;: Lanier graduates from Oglethorpe College in Milledgeville, Georgia, enlists in the Confederate Army, captured by Union soldiers near Wilmington, North Carolina, and placed at Point Lookout Prison in Saint Mary’s County, Maryland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was Point Lookout?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”a Union POW camp, with bitter cold conditions and no barracks, the captured soldiers and civilians died by the scores. Of the fifty thousand detainees, some four thousand perished, and countless others contracted tuberculosis. Lanier was not spared, and he left the jail skinny and emaciated, bound to suffer from consumption for the rest of his short life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1867&lt;/strong&gt;: Lanier published his only novel, Tiger Lilies, about his time at Point Lookout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1873&lt;/strong&gt;: Lanier offered the position of first flute in the Peabody Symphony Orchestra (1866-1896) by Asger Hamerik&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letter from Lanier to wife, c. 1873:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[we could] “dwell in [this] beautiful city, among the great libraries, and [in the] midst of the music, the religion, and the art that we love–and I could write my books and be the man I wish to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1879&lt;/strong&gt;: Lanier appointed a lecturer in English literature at JHU&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1881&lt;/strong&gt;: Lanier died from tuberculosis at age 39, buried in Green Mount Cemetery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;johns-hopkins-university&quot;&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: It may make sense to include some discussion on the relationship of Johns Hopkins University to Confederate memory in Baltimore and historical scholarship on the Civil War and Reconstruction in Maryland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential topics could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;W.E.B. Dubois on Johns Hopkins University (see Memory in Black and White)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Rise of Jim Crow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Blight at Johns Hopkins University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;homewood-house&quot;&gt;Homewood House&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shriver-hall&quot;&gt;Shriver Hall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1939, alumnus and Baltimore attorney, Alfred Jenkins Shriver, left the University the residue of his estate to build a lecture hall. According to the peculiar conditions of the will, Shriver Hall was to be adorned with murals depicting the Hopkins class of 1891 (Shriver’s class), the original faculties of philosophy and of medicine, the original boards of trustees of the University and the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore clipper ships, ten Baltimore philanthropists, and ten “famous beauties of Baltimore,” who were named in Mr. Shriver’s will. The last mural has inspired controversy from the time it was publicly announced, including objections from some of the women named in the will, who did not wish to be painted.The university was forced to accept the terms of the gift-or lose it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Material:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 1928&lt;/strong&gt;: J. Harry Ferguson, president of the Colonial Trust Company, died and, in his will, provided a gift of $100,000 to the Baltimore Municipal Arts Society providing for the erection of a monument dedicated to Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. Jackson.
&lt;strong&gt;October 1934&lt;/strong&gt;: In his will, Ferguson required that the gift be turned over only after the death of his sister, Ella F. Ward, who passed away on October 10, 1934.
&lt;strong&gt;1936&lt;/strong&gt;: Design selected, controversial reception centered largely on the authenticity of the hats and other clothing worn by the figures.
&lt;strong&gt; July 1939&lt;/strong&gt;: Construction begins on the pedestal. Artist planned to be done in the summer of 1938; in August 1939, the artist offered a new estimate of completion for early 1941. Later revised to late spring 1942, the work stopped again due to “an acute shortage of Italian clay” and limits on metal during World War II.
&lt;strong&gt;1948&lt;/strong&gt;: Lee-Jackson Monument dedicated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The following is an extended excerpt from our essay on &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/baltimore-civil-rights-heritage/confederate-memory/&quot;&gt;Confederate Memory in Baltimore&lt;/a&gt;. This section should be edited to identify key quotes and summarize the perspective of the various historical actors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing on May 1, 1948, The Sun editorialized that “the laymen, or at least most of the laymen with whom we have talked” saw the Lee-Jackson Monument as a “noble thing” noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”They are willing to believe, here and now, that this monument will be loved at and enjoyed by people who know little and care less about the incident it commemorates. They rejoice in its setting, and the appropriateness of its pedestal. They hold, and we go along with them, that here is one memorial which raises the average of our public art and helps support our reputation as the Monumental City.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same day, 3,000 people came out to see the dedication (many waving Confederate flags reportedly sold by “hawkers” selling them for just $1 each). The Sun reported on Governor William Preston Lane Jr.’s remarks about the monument to “two men who best typify the gallantry and statesmanship of the Confederacy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing that the scars of the Civil War have long since been healed, the Governor asserted “our might is the sole remaining bulwark on which the free peoples of the world rest their hopes for remaining free, and to which they look for succor agains the juggernaut of oppression that is threatening to engulf them. The Governor explained the monument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“is symbolic of our unity of purpose, as a nation, to preserve those things which our forefathers, and those of our generations, have fought, and in the attainment of them, raised among us men of the stature of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.”
“We honor here in this bronze, the character and the ability, the strength of conviction and the devotion to a cause, of two men who were great Americans, albeit they rose in this greatness and enshrined themselves in the hearts of their countrymen in a cause that was lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing on May 15, 1948, the editorial board of The Baltimore Afro-American took a different approach, commenting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Speaking at the dedication of a Robert E. Lee-Stonewall Jackson monument in Baltimore a week ago, Gov. William Preston Lane said that the scars of the Civil War have long since healed. What does he mean, “healed”? The governor is president of a conference of governors of 17 Southern States whose chief goal now is to keep all existing college, university, and professional schools “for white only” and, in general, to oppose President Truman’s program of civil rights for all. Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro of Baltimore said, “we can look for inspiration to the lives of Lee and Jackson to remind us to be resolute and determined in preserving our sacred institutions. The “sacred institution” which Lee and Jackson sought to wreck was this Federal union of ours. The “sacred institution” they sought to preserve was slavery. Actually both Lee and Jackson were an example of small town rebels who walked roughshod over humble people in an attempt to build a State on the foundation of slave labor. Hitler killed Jews. Lee and Jackson exploited colored people as animals and property. […] These traitors are today held up before us by the Governor of the State, the Mayor of the city, and bishop Noble C. Powell of the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland, and Brother Douglass Freeman of Richmond, Va., editor of the News Leader, as characters to whom we can look for “inspiration”(?) This is pure drivel and tommyrot. So far as the mayor is concerned, we know he was merely making a speech. He doesn’t believe in the confederacy stuff. As for Governor Lane and Bishop Powell, we wonder? If some crack-pot with a diseased brain should leave the city a few thousand dollars with which to erect a memorial to Benedict Arnold, there are probably some church, city and State officials, who could be persuaded by the Daughters of the American Revolution to build it, and to orate its dedication. In Washington this past week the House of Representatives voted to pay the Tampa, Fla., chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy $1000 for damage done to a confederate monument by U.S. sailors on shore leave. The boys didn’t like the rebel statue and toppled it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 1948&lt;/strong&gt;: Strom Thurmond campaigns in Baltimore, stops at the Lee-Jackson Monument&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The States’ Rights Democratic Party (better known as the Dixiecrats) was a short-lived effort to encourage Southern voters to vote in opposition to civil rights by supporting then South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond as a candidate for President. Initial plans, reported on October 1, 1948, called for Strom Thurmond to gather at the Lee-Jackson Monument with Bertram L. Coone, 2d, Maryland Secretary of State, representing Governor Lane; the eight States’ Rights Democrat electors; Miss Frances Munford, women’s chairman for Maryland and other officers of the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 2, the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt; reported on the visit, writing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Governor Thurmond’s main speech was made last night at the Lyric Theater, after a day of appearances that attracted little attention in the city. &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;…&lt;/a&gt; The next stop of the Thurmond car with its waving flag of the Southern Confederacy was at the Lee-Jackson monument near the Museum of Art. There the Governor was greeted by David Maguire, a Loyola College student, garbed in the rented uniform of a Confederate brigadier-general. Pictures were taken. There was no speech. The crowd was even smaller than the one at the armory. The Loyola College student said the outfit was the idea of The Greyhound, Loyola publication, but did not indicate any support for the States’ Rights candidate. “We might pull another stunt for Governor Dewey or President Truman if they come here,” he said. […] At a press conference in the Southern Hotel, Governor Thurmond said many people “are deceived by the name ‘Civil Rights’ given to the legislative proposals which we challenge as violating these principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate editorial, the Sun plaintively asked “Why Not Leave Lee and Jackson Out of It?” continuing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Lee-Jackson monument has been highly praised as a work of art and the sentiment attaching to it could not fail to make it appeal to any southerner. On a sight-seeing tour of the city by a person from below the Potomac it obviously is a must. There will be some, however, who will regret the propagandist aspects attending Governor Thurmond’s visit to the monument, just as they have regretted the use of General Lee’s picture in connection with other public demonstrations of the Dixiecrats. General Lee and General Jackson were professional soldiers who kept clear of politics. Neither was active in the movement for secession that preceded war. When the time came to make a decision, it is true that both embraced the cause of their State against the Federal Union. Certainly in the case of Lee, the decision was made with great reluctance. It may be doubted whether either Lee or Jackson would relish being the symbol of any political party. Since neither Lee nor Jackson is here to express an opinion, or to approve, wouldn’t it be better to leave them out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Johns Hopkins University declined to rent their facilities to the Sons of Confederate Veterans after 20 years of hosting Lee-Jackson Monument programs on their campus. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cwreenactors.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-11331.html&quot;&gt;letter posted to a forum for Civil War reenactors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Every year since 1988, the Johns Hopkins University has rented the Clipper Room in Shriver Hall, or on several occasions another facility, to the Son of Confederate Veterans to hold our post ceremony social gathering. However this year is different. The John Hopkins University has refused to rent the Clipper Room, or any other facility, to our organization. The sole reason given, per a Johns Hopkins representative, was that we are a “Confederate” organization. Make no mistake about it, we were not denied because the facility was unavailable, or for any other legitimate reason, we were denied because of who we are. In addition, the Hopkins representative stated that this ruling came directly from the President of the Johns Hopkins University, Mr. William Brody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-and-discussion&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Discussion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-reinterpret-the-past&quot;&gt;How to reinterpret the past&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Shackel on how dominant interpretation can change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Subordinated groups may subscribe to the dominant interpretation, ignore the dominant view, or fight for representation in the public memory. Transforming the public memory of any sacred place does not come without persistence, hard work, and compromise. While there are often strong movement to eliminate subordinated memories from our national collective memory, some minority groups battle to have their histories remembered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-make-comments&quot;&gt;How to make comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-baltimore-has-discussed-this-issue-before&quot;&gt;How Baltimore has discussed this issue before&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people in Baltimore opposed the creation of these monuments, criticized the racism within the Confederate memorial agenda. While examples of direct responses to the early monuments are hard to find, it is clear that black activists saw the symbols of Confederate memory as a rallying point for opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1880, scores of Baltimore’s Union veterans petitioned against a proposal to locate a Confederate monument on Eutaw Place. Even some Confederate veterans stood up in opposition, among them Charles T. Crane who wrote to the &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt; stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am unwilling to see erected in the public streets of this city a monument to a dead idea, but which will be a standing menace, and a source of bitterness not only to a great number of the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland, but to a great number of the people of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a strong vote of approval from the Baltimore City Council, the city’s Mayor Ferdinand C. Latrobe returned the resolution “without his approval,” noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The public highways and squares of the city are the common property of all, and we who are temporarily entrusted with their control, whatever our personal opinions may be, are not, in my judgment, justified in dedicating any portion of them to a purpose which would be in direct opposition to the sensibilities and wishes of large numbers of citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Confederate veterans continued to try to diminish the importance of slavery to the Civil War, Baltimore’s native son Frederick Douglass remarked in 1884:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is not well to forget the past. Memory was given to man for some wise purpose. The past is… the mirror in which we may discern the dim outlines of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech in Washington, DC delivered in 1889, Douglass likely spoke for many African Americans when he noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well the nation may forget, it may shut its eyes to the past, and frown upon any who may do otherwise, but the colored people of this country are bound to keep the past in lively memory till justice shall be done them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Mount Vernon Place – Stories of Slavery &amp; Emancipation</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;1: Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the initial introduction is to establish context for interpreting enslavement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 5, 1862 - “Wanted - A good Colored Cook, Washer, and Ironer. Slave preferred. Apply at 62 Mt. Vernon Place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slavery is not a uniform or totalizing experience, experiences are different depending on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;geography, e.g. Eastern Shore v. Baltimore&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;time period, e.g. War of 1812 v. Civil War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;individual circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we talk about slavery matters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say “enslaved people” not “slaves,”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Say “slaveholder” not “slave owner”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources for understanding slavery in Baltimore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Census&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Directories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WPA Slave Narratives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;south-square&quot;&gt;2: South Square&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establish historic context of slavery and freedom in pre-Civil War Baltimore - begin with example tied to Lafayette Monument and move forward in time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lafayette-monument-1924&quot;&gt;Lafayette Monument (1924)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sculptor Andrew O’Connor, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explain: Marquis de Lafayette’s life opens a window in the changing nature of slavery in Baltimore and the United States between his arrival in U.S. in 1777 and his death in 1834.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1783&lt;/strong&gt;: Marquis de Lafayette writes to Washington&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lafayette always expressed paternalistic sympathies for “the black part of mankind.” His first encounter with slaves was with oystermen in South Carolina in 1777. He suggested using black troops in the American conflict and employed a former slave, James Armistead “Lafayette,” as a spy and trusted valet.[1]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1783, after reading Condorcet’s Réflexions sur l’Esclavage des Nègres (1781), the Marquis de Lafayette wrote his old commander George Washington suggesting an experiment. The two would purchase land where Washington’s slaves would then work as free tenants. Lafayette believed that Washington’s participation in the project would help to “render it a general practice.” Lafayette hoped that his plan would prove successful in the United States and then spread it out into the West Indies. Lafayette expressed the passionate sentiment that “If it be a wild scheme, I had rather be mad in this way, than to be thought wise in the other task.” By June of 1785, Lafayette was ready to begin the experiment, ordering his attorney to purchase a plantation in French Guiana with the proviso that none of the slaves on the plantation be sold or exchanged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From then on, he became part of an international network of activists. His last known letter was addressed to an abolitionist society in Glasgow (May 1834).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1789&lt;/strong&gt;: George Washington serving his first term as President (1789-1797)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Baltimore population only 12000 white people, 1250 enslaved blacks, little over 300 free blacks (1790)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1799&lt;/strong&gt;: George Washington’s death, Santo Domingo Revolution begins in Haiti&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the time of George Washington’s death, the Mount Vernon estate’s enslaved population consisted of 318 people. Washington himself had been a slave owner for fifty-six years, beginning at eleven years of age when he inherited ten slaves from his deceased father.[2]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1815&lt;/strong&gt;: Washington Monument cornerstone laid, 3 years before Frederick Douglass’ birth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 47000 people in Baltimore, 36000 white, 4600 enslaved people, 5600 free blacks[3]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1829&lt;/strong&gt;: Charles Howard builds the first house on Mount Vernon Place, 2 years before Nat Turner’s Rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;90,000 enslaved people in Maryland, in Baltimore over 61000 white people, 4100 enslaved people in Baltimore, nearly 1500 free blacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summarize&lt;/strong&gt;: What happened to slavery in Baltimore in the early 19th century?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, for most Baltimoreans of the first decades of the 19th century, regardless of their occupation, slave-owning was an unaffordable luxury.” (Black Social Capital, 1999)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proportion of city residents who held slaves declined
- Nearly 1/3 of city residents held at least one enslaved person in 1800, slaveholders were just over 1% of the city’s white population in 1850&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Percentage of Baltimore’s total population held in slavery declined
- 9% in 1790, just under 2% in 1850, barely 1% in 1860&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Percentage of black population in freedom grew
- 20% in 1790, over 75% in 1830, over 90% in 1860&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;west-square&quot;&gt;West Square&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain&lt;/strong&gt;: Free and enslaved black people worked in the houses around Mount Vernon Place as domestic servants, cooks, maids, butlers, grooms and stablemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For enslaved and free blacks, domestic service sometimes offered opportunity for “living out”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Living out: “Because slavery in Baltimore centered on domestic service, nontraditional arrangements were common. Harriet Stoke, a twenty-four-year-old house servant of Daniel Parrish, was allowed to live “near the spring with her father,” a free Negro who resided on Eden Street.” (Phillips)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic service required slaves to adapt their dress and manners to the work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frederick Douglass recalled his mistress preparing for his move to Baltimore by trading in a knee-length tow shirt (common on the plantation) for trousers reflecting the “refinement” of urban bondage. (Freedom’s Port)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christian Fleetwood, young free black who later served as a , remembered a white benefactor insisting he be “elegantly dressed in embroidered jacket with silk hose.” (Freedom’s Port) More on Christian Fleetwood (grew up in the home of John C. Brune, sugar merchant who lived at St. Paul and Mulberry Street): http://blogs.loc.gov/civil-war-voices/about/christian-fleetwood/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no class of people to whom cleanliness of person and attire is of more importance than to servants in genteel families.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Robert Robert’s chapter on “The Benefit of Early Rising to Servants” in his 1827 Guide for Butlers &amp;amp; Other Household Staff. Roberts, an African American butler and active participant in Boston’s abolitionist movement, strove for perfection in his work.[4]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”And so our slave was getting along, making, probably, two guineas a week over and above the share of his wages due to his owners. Every month or so he would draw his pay from the steam-boat or hotel proprietor he might be serving at the time, take it home and divide it with his “misses,” have a chat with the old lady, and pay her homage by waiting at table in his highest style, and perhaps, as our Artist saw him, escort her to and from the “meetin’-house.””

&lt;p&gt;1 West Mount Place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residence built between 1848 and 1850 for Dr. John Hanson Thomas (1813-1881) and Mrs. Thomas (?-1886)
Described as “one of the most elegant and princely specimens of architectural taste and mechanical skill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A noted bank president in Baltimore and member of the Maryland legislature from 1861-1865; Dr. Hanson was arrested for advocating secession and imprisoned for six months in four Federal forts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mrs. Thomas had grown up in a slaveholding home[5]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertaining in style required skilled labor
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas liked entertaining guests including Prince of Wales before he became Edward VII, Polish revolutionary Kossuth - whose suggested confection became the traditional Kossuth cake. The house featured a 60 foot long double parlor, connecting a great hall to the library and dining room; Gothic Revival dining room featured golden oak paneling and a brass-studded ceiling. (Dorsey, 37)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1860, house held 2 female slaves, including a cook Sybby Grant (Clayton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 6, 1861 letter from Sybby Grant to Dr. Hanson opens question on relationships:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“My Freind [sic], i take this opportunity to write you a few lines to inquire after your health i hope you are in good health i miss you very much in deed i hope you will be restored to your family again for i will ever hold you as a freind [sic] of mine when ever i cook a good dinner i wish you was here to enjoy it yesterday we had a fine pair of canvas backs ducks made a present to Miss anna they was cook splendid and i wish yous was here to enjoy them those terapins [sic] i [sent?] i done them in stile for you know that no one can do them like i can i knever [sic] get on my knees but what i ask God to remember you that God that delivered the children of isural will deliver you if you put your trust in him good night may God bless you miss anna is well and her ma is better miss nannie and miss Mary came down to night to let me see them after they were dress to go to the party they look very [pert?] miss anna wearing curls you ought to behold her face now no more at presen i remain you humle [sic] servant Sybby Grant”[6]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April 18, 1861, William Walters attended a rally of the States’ Rights Party&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Appointed a delegate by the party, he was deputized to protest to the presidents of the regional railways against the use of their lines for conveying federal troops to Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native Pennsylvania, strong financial ties to the south&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“With the surrender of Fort Sumter… on April 14, 1861, Walters organized a subscription to fire a salute in honor of the occasion.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ailed after assisting, two daughters of Texas Senator Louis Trezevant Wigfall, helped to arrange for their transportation south to Richmond via Harper’s Ferry, accompanied by his brother Edwin Walters with permission from Secretary of War Simon Cameron&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August 8, 1861 William Walters submitted an application, servant Betsey Anthony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1860, Walters’ household maintain by four servants, one white Elizabeth “Betsey” Anthony eventually buried in the family mausoleum at GreenMount Cemetery, along with John Thompson (black, 26), Sarah Smith (mulatto, age 20), Mary Smith Mullato (mulatto, age 17)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert and Elizebth Garrett commissioned house, designed by Louis L. Long&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in 1847, Robert Garrett was followed by two brothers, T. Harrison (Harry), Henry (an invalid, most-likely from birth), and a sister, Mary Elizabeth. Robert was reared among the privileged graduating from Princeton College in 1867. However, when he was 16, he ran away from home to join the Virginia Company during the Civil War. His father persuaded him to return home and complete college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1853 but enlarged in the 1870s to encompass four houses made into one with approximately 40 rooms, 100 windows, and 16 fireplaces. Renovation was wedding present for Robert Garrett, the elder son of John Work Garrett who was the President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Robert Garrett &amp;amp; Sons, bankers and his wife Mary Frick in 1872.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1860, Robert Garrett (Mary Elizabeth Garett’s father) owned 1 male slave, employed a free black male, and three white servants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Across the street in the Thomas Mansion, a French governess worked with four free blacks and two slaves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Macks (1844 - ca1932) ex-slave, caterer at 541 W. Biddle Street. Born into slavery in Charles County, spent 11 years as head butler to Robert Garrett at Garrett Jacobs Mansion. WPA Slave Narrative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”I was born in Charles County in Southern Maryland in the year of 1844. My father’s name was William (Bill) and Mother’s Harriet Mack, both of whom were born and reared in Charles County-the county that James Wilkes Booth took refuge in after the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. I had one sister named Jenny and no brothers: let me say right here it was God’s blessing I did not. Near Bryantown, a county center prior to the Civil War as a market for tobacco, grain and market for slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”I lived with my mother, father and sister in a log cabin built of log and mud, having two rooms; one with a dirt floor and the other above, each room having two windows, but no glass. On a large farm or plantation owned by an old maid by the name of Sally McPherson on McPherson Farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”As a small boy and later on, until I was emancipated, I worked on the farm doing farm work, principally in the tobacco fields and in the woods cutting timber and firewood. I slept on a home-made bed or bunk, while my mother and sister slept in a bed made by father on which they had a mattress made by themselves and filled with straw, while dad slept on a bench beside the bed and that he used in the day as a work bench, mending shoes for the slaves and others. I have seen mother going to the fields each day like other slaves to do her part of the farming. I being considered as one of the household employees, my work was both in the field and around the stable, giving me an opportunity to meet people some of whom gave me a few pennies. By this method I earned some money which I gave to my mother. I once found a gold dollar, that was the first dollar I ever had in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”I remember well when President Buchanan was elected, I was a large boy. I came to Baltimore when General Grant was elected, worked in a livery stable for three years, three years with Dr. Owens as a waiter and coachman, 3 years with Mr. Thomas Winans on Baltimore Street as a butler, 3 years with Mr. Oscar Stillman of Boston, then 11 years with Mr. Robert Garrett on Mt. Vernon Place as head butler, after which I entered the catering business and continued until about twelve years ago. In my career I have had the opportunity to come in contact with the best white people and the most cultured class in Maryland and those visiting Baltimore. This class is about gone, now we have a new group, lacking the refinement, the culture and taste of those that have gone by.”[8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African American caterers prospered near Mount Vernon following the Civil War included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James W. Hughes (1849-1921), 12 E. Centre Street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Coming to this city at age 18 , two years after the close of civil war, and hampered as he was by the lack of common schooling, which every boy today enjoys, he entered business, and by sheer merit and persistence achieved success. His work made him friends as well as customers, who heralded abroad the fame of his culinary skill.”[9]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;President of the YMCA, long-time treasurer for St. James, contributor to the NAACP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Established Hughes Catering Company, 1884 at 524 St. Paul Street, moved to 12 E. Centre Street ca1905&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Simms and daughter Mrs. Emma Simmes, 1045 Cathedral Street&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Born in Annapolis ca, Benjamin Simms came to Baltimore in employ of Lennox Birckhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job opportunities for free blacks changed before and after the Civil War:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1850s, competition from whites and violence against blacks in skilled trades - like caulking - forced free and, by 1860s, emancipated blacks into less skilled trades including the service industry.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catering declined in late 19th early 20th century, changing dining preferences, alcohol with need for permits, bonds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1860 US Census Slave Schedule a Zenus Barnum, residing in Baltimore, Maryland owned a black female slave, aged 20 years. Zenus Barnum was president of the Northern Central Railroad and of several telegraph companies and also a partner in the Barnum Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

West side of Mt. Vernon between St. Paul and Washington Place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Timothy P. Andrews: Born in Ireland in 1794, and served in the War of 1812 under Commodore Barney and with a District of Columbia volunteer company in the field. A regular army officer, he was breveted Brigadier-General U.S.A. on 13th September for meritorious conduct at the Battle of Chapultepec in Mexico. During the Civil War, Andrews served as a Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Paymaster on the staff of Major-General Henry W. Halleck and later as Paymaster General with the rank of Colonel. His son Richard Snowden Andrews served in the Confederate forces as a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Maryland Artillery, subsequently writing a memoir of his service.[10]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clayton: in 1860, Gen. Andrews held:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 male slave, Nathan, 32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 female slave, Emily, 18&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 female slave, Cherry, 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Snowden Andrews, later a founding member of AIA Baltimore, fought for the Confederacy, his memoir references a free black nurse employed by his household in 1863.[11]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decatur-miller-house-1853---700-cathedral-street&quot;&gt;Decatur Miller House (1853) - 700 Cathedral Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed by Niernsee &amp;amp; Neilson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1860, Decatur Miller held two female slaves, real estate valued at $25,000, personal estate at $10,000. General property tax records notes his furniture, plates and slaves valued at $5,720.[12] (Clayton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 1853, Decatur Miller’s new house-headlined as a “magnificent residence”-had “advanced to completion.” In his early thirties at the time of the house’s construction, Decatur Miller and his wife Eliza had clearly “arrived.” …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1850, his profession was listed as a “commercial tobacco merchant;” by 1860, he rose to the somewhat vague, but clearly privileged status of “gentleman.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From F. Winkleman, recorded as digging and lining the privy for $52.00, to J. W. &amp;amp; H. T. Gernhard, who sold Miller a stained glass skylight for $115.00, to O. Bouldmg, responsible for surveying the lot, no fewer than thirty-six individuals and firms were involved in either supplying materials or aspects of the house’s planning and construction. To have the plans for his four-story house brought to fruition, Decatur Miller-like his other class contemporaries-and architects Niernsee &amp;amp; Neilson needed a variety of skilled and unskilled laborers, both for general construction requirements as well as those more specific to elite mid-nineteenth-century construction.[13]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where did servants and enslaved people live and work in these houses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wealthy households like the Millers required the employment of relatively large numbers of servants and, accordingly, their houses contained a number of service spaces necessary for executing various domestic tasks. In addition to the public and semipublic spaces positioned forward on the ground floor, that level also included a housekeeper’s room, pantry, storeroom, kitchen, “and other conveniences,” with cellars, ostensibly for storage, located below.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 1850 Baltimore City census schedules noted a twenty-six year old woman, Kate M. Kamfer, resident in the Miller household. While the occupation of this woman, born in Germany, is not known, she was undoubtedly a servant of some sort, given the patterns of census information as well as the affluence of the Millers. By this time the Millers had two young children, and Kamfer may have been their nurse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 1860 schedules also only included a single servant, twenty-six year old Bessie Kelly, who was born in Ireland and nurse to the Miller’s four children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Oldest house on Mt. Vernon Place, built from design book plans for William Tiffany, who lived in the 25 room house until 1859&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1863, the house was briefly home to the Allston Club - a group of Baltimore artists, who met one evening a week at the studio of Frank B. Mayer, organized a regular club in the winter of 1858 at Dr. John Buckler’s residence, 40 St. Paul Street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In February 1863, the Allston Association moved to the Oliver Mansion:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Owing to the pronounced Southern sentiments of its members, the club-house was closed by order of General Schenck, commandant of the Middle Department on the 30th of June, 1863, the first day of the battle of Gettysburg, when the result of the battle was uncertain, and the Confederate army was hourly expected in Baltimore. The club-house remained closed during the continuance of the war. General Schenck advised his successor not to allow it to be re-opened, as it had been ‘a nest of secessionists’“[14]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artist William Henry Rinehart, resting one hand on the Constitution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who was Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney of Maryland?
Taney, slaveholder, secessionist, anti-slavery “legend”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1818, served as a defense attorney for an abolitionist minister, denounced slavery in remarks, same year emancipated at least 8 enslaved people:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1857, soon after Dred Scott, Taney wrote: “I am not a slaveholder. More than thirty years ago I manumitted every slave I ever owned except two who were two old when they became my property to provide for themselves. These two I supported in comfort as long as they lived. And I am glad to say that none of those whom I manumitted disappointed my expectations, but have show by their conduct that they were worthy of freedom.”[15]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Taney left Frederick and established a law office in Baltimore in 1823; in 1827 he was appointed Attorney General of Maryland, later campaigned for Andrew Jackson and following him to Washington, DC as attorney General of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taney’s views on slavery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1832, Taney wrote: “The African race in the United State even when free are everywhere a degraded class… The privileges they are allowed to enjoy, are accorded to them as a matter of kindness and benevolence rather than right… [Negroes] were not looked upon as citizens by the contracting parties who formed the Constitution.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 1874 memoir Taney wrote: “For a long period, if not through its whole duration, the relation of master and slave was best for both races, and especially for the negro as it raised him from pagan barbarism to a phase of Christian civilization.”[16]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In December 1855, Taney sold the family house in Baltimore after the death of his wife Anne Key Taney and daughter Alice Taney from yellow fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who was Dred Scott?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An illiterate St. Louis slave named Dred Scott sued his owner for his freedom. He won in state court, lost on appeal, filed a new case in federal court, lost again, and then appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The case was argued twice in the Supreme Court in 1856, just as Americans had begun to debate slavery with more than words. In between the two arguments, warfare broke out in Kansas and an abolitionist was beaten nearly to death in the U.S. Senate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taney and the Dred Scott case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“By the time the Dred Scott case reached the court in 1856, in the words of a historian, the 80-year-old chief justice was “a bitter sectionalist, seething with anger at Northern insult and Northern aggression.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And so, on March 6, 1857, before a country that was a tinderbox, the court struck a match. In a harsh, racially driven majority opinion written by Chief Justice Taney, the court rejected Dred Scott’s claim for freedom, holding that blacks in bondage were property without rights and Congress had no power to halt the spread of slavery. Chief Justice Taney intended to end the slavery controversy forever by resolving every slavery issue in favor of the South. Instead, his opinion, which effectively nationalized slavery, made sectional compromise impossible and hurled the country toward the abyss. A wave of Northern outrage descended on Chief Justice Taney, while the South warned that unless the North accepted the opinion, there would be disunion.”[17]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 1857, Frederick Douglass responded to Dred Scott decision:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While four millions of our fellow countrymen are in chains - while men, women, and children are bought and sold on the auction-block with horses, sheep, and swine - while the remorseless slave-whip draws the warm blood of our common humanity - it is meet that we assemble as we have done to-day, and lift up our hearts and voices in earnest denunciation of the vile and shocking abomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”You may close your Supreme Court against the black man’s cry for justice, but you cannot, thank God, close against him the ear of a sympathising world, nor shut up the Court of Heaven. All that is merciful and just, on earth and in Heaven, will execrate and despise this edict of Taney.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memorials supported reconciliation between North &amp;amp; South around a “ Lost Cause” narrative&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Blight writes on how the Lost Cause transformed into national reunion on Southern terms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Memorial Day, June 5, 1879, A. M. Keiley, of Richmond, spoke at “Loundon Park,” explaining, it was “love of state and love of home” for which Southerners fought the war … Keiley found “reconciliation easy with him who says, ‘I answered the summons of Massachusetts or Ohio,’ for I answered the summons of Virginia, and hers alone.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Eager Howard (1752-1827)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born at “Belvedere” in Baltimore County, Maryland on June 4, 1752, John Eager Howard was educated by private tutors. During the Revolutionary War, he joined the Continental Army, serving as captain of the 2nd Maryland Battalion, Flying Camp. He fought heroically in the battles of Germantown, Camden and Cowpens, for which he was awarded a silver medal by Congress, and earned the rank of major general by the time he was discharged in 1795. Howard entered politics in 1787, winning election to the Continental Congress. The Maryland legislature elected Howard governor on November 24, 1788. He was reelected in 1789 and again in 1790.[18]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked as a member of the American Colonization Society, along with Francis Scott Key, to promote the migration of free blacks to Africa in the 1810s and 1820s.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;The Latrobe (1911, Glidden &amp;amp; Friz) at Charles and Read - site of John H.B. Latrobe’s 1860s mansion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John H.B. Latrobe&lt;/strong&gt;, principal organizer and corresponding secretary of the Maryland chapter of the American Colonization Society;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Son of John Eager Howard, Charles Howard and Charles C. Harper (son of Robert Goodloe Harper) hired Robert S. Finley to promote colonization around the state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But for most free people of color, colonization came to look more and more like White-imposed deportation-one that they were determined to resist.(Resistance, 37)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The problem was particularly acute in Baltimore, a city in the anomalous position of existing within a slave state while simultaneously containing the largest population of free people of color in the country before the Civil War. Free people of color stood up to mounting pressures for their colonization to Africa, pressures generated by resentment of Black autonomy and fear of slave insurrection displaced onto free African Americans. Colonizationists ultimately failed to persuade many Blacks in the Chesapeake to embark for Africa, due in no small measure to African Americans forestalling attempts to cajole or coerce relocation. ((Resistance, 38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In one dramatic incident, Black men boarded a ship about to embark from Baltimore harbor and persuaded half of the Africa-bound passengers to remain in America after all. (Resistance, 40)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mt-vernon-united-methodist-church&quot;&gt;Mt. Vernon United Methodist Church&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methodism had an early association with abolitionism&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the first major white religious voices against slavery, Asbury petitioned George Washington to enact anti-slavery legislation. Francis Ashbury presented an anti-slavery petition from Methodist bishops to George Washington. Wrote in his journal:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;December 19, 1796: “My spirit was grieved at the conduct of some Methodists, that hire slaves at public places to the highest bidder, to cut skin, and starve them; I think such members ought to be dealt with: on the side of oppressors there are law and power, but where are justice and mercy to the poor slaves? what eye will pity, what hand will help, or ear listen to their distresses? I will try if words can be like drawn sword, to pierce the hearts of the owners.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sharp Street Church established with help of Methodist Abolitionists, Bethel AME&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;east-square&quot;&gt;East Square&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reporting in 1848, the Baltimore Sun bragged on how houses, “little short of regal palaces in point of splendor are springing into existence like magic,” and in the “immediate neighborhood of the Washington Monument” … “beautiful abodes of wealth and luxury” could be found in great number. (Architecture of Baltimore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;branch-alley&quot;&gt;Branch Alley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the 3-story back building, carriage house and stable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape to Baltimore&lt;/strong&gt;: Richard Mason of Charles County advertised for his “escaped man,”” Phil Carter, observing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“it is very possible that he is gone to Baltimore, as his father is living there on Howard’s hill, and is a dray man, his name is James Carter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alleys inevitably narrow - no more than 12’ wide by city codes - and became home to dense communities of both enslaved and free blacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legislation passed in 1819 set a maximum term of six years in the penitentiary in Baltimore for any free person White or Black, who “enticed, persuaded, or assisted,” or knowingly harbored, any runaway slave.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rather than a maximum of six years imprisonment, in 1849 the penalty for attempted escape grew to a minimum of six years, and not to exceed 15; the sanctioned number of lashes was also increased to 40, but ultimately the number to be administered was at the discretion of the court.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 1835, 10 times as many blacks as whites lived on alleys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segregation developed around limited employment opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over 350 of the free blacks identified in the 1860 census listed their occupations as Carter, drayman, or carriage driver, a number only matched by the 570 laborers, and around 225 waiters and porters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1855, Frederick Douglass wrote on Baltimore from New York:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Every hour sees the black man elbowed out of the employment by some newly arrived emigrant whose hunger and color are thought to give him a better title to the place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Wallis had addressed a mass-meeting in Monument Square on April 9, and assured his hearers that his heart was with the South and that he was willing to join in the defence of Baltimore against the Federal troops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night of September 12, soldiers seized Wallis at his house, as well as the other Baltimore members of the Legislature, George William Brown, the Mayor, and Henry May, who represented one of the city districts in the Federal House of Representatives, having been elected over Henry Winter Davis in the spring. They were carried at once to Fort McHenry and thence on the next day to Fort Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note from Tane-hisi Coates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It should always be remembered that America did not “go to war” in 1860. America was attacked in 1860 by a formidable rebel faction seeking to protect the expansion of slavery. That faction did not simply want slavery to continue in America; they dreamed of a tropical empire of slavery encompassing Cuba, Nicaragua, and perhaps the whole of South America. This faction was not only explicitly pro-slavery but explicitly anti-democratic. The newly declared Confederacy attacked America not because it was being persecuted, but because it was unable to win a democratic election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peabody-monument-1890&quot;&gt;Peabody Monument (1890)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artist William W. Story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;George Peabody started his business in Georgetown and sold dry good throughout the South, never took a position on abolition and was criticized for Confederate sympathies near the beginning of the Civil War.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thurlow Weed, one of three emissaries sent to Europe by Lincoln in October 1861, later recalled a conversation with Peabody who believed that the Civil War was avoidable:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“I think now that the Northern side is more in the right than I had thought it was. For several months my talks have been with Americans who presented the question differently. The business years of my life, as you know, were spent in Georgetown, District of Columbia, and in Baltimore. My private sympathies while in England have been against the institution of slavery. But during these many years of excitement on that subject I regarded the extremists of both sides as equally mischievous. This view made me think that extreme men were alike enemies of the Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;george-peabody-and-the-peabody-education-fund&quot;&gt;George Peabody and the Peabody Education Fund&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hailed in his lifetime as “the most liberal philanthropist of ancient or modern time,” Peabody is recognized today as the founder of modern philanthropy. George Peabody’s $2 million gift establishing the Peabody Education Fund supported education at all levels in the eleven former Confederate states and West Virginia. Many northerners and southerners alike believed this ambitious venture was the surest means of healing the wounds left in the wake of the Civil War.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first meeting of the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund was held at Willard’s Hotel in Washington, D.C., on February 8, 1867. There, former governors of northern and southern states mingled for the first time since the beginning of hostilities. The Peabody Education Fund, which established a public education system for the states of the American South, was George Peabody’s largest single benefaction. Taking a position that was astonishing for that era, Peabody insisted on providing educational opportunities for all races.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;George Peabody, February 7, 1867: “I feel most deeply, therefore, that it is the duty and privilege of the more favored and wealthy portions of our nation to assist those who are less fortunate; and, with the wish to discharge so far as I may be able my own responsibility in this matter, as well as to gratify my desire to aid those to whom I am bound by so many ties of attachment and regard, I give to you, gentlemen, most of whom have been my personal and especial friends, the sum of one million of dollars, to be by you and your successors held in trust, and the income therefore used and applied in your discretion for the promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, or industrial education among the young of the more destitute portions of the Southern and Southwestern States of our Union; my purpose being that the benefits intended shall be distributed among the entire population, without other distinction than their needs and the opportunities of usefulness to them.”[21]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connection to George N. Eaton and Hooper C. Eaton at 54 Mt. Vernon Place, E. Bros. &amp;amp; Co.); George N. Eaton was later a trustee for the Peabody Fund; Eaton Chas. J.M. lived at 52 Mt. Vernon Place; Eaton Bros. - dry goods commission merchants, 13 s. Charles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;th-amendment-celebration&quot;&gt;15th Amendment Celebration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“While the 15th Amendment was celebrated in Boston and Chicago, the celebration in Baltimore was by far the largest, with over 20,000 people participating, including Frederick Douglass, Martin Delany, and Hiram Revels were all prominent blacks who had a legacy Baltimore. The parade and ensuing speeches were extremely grand. The route, taking participants past the home of Isaac Myers, past Orchard Street (the “black Fifth Avenue of Baltimore”), through Pigtown, and through the most prestigious white residences in Baltimore at Mt. Vernon Place and on Madison Street, made a loud and clear declaration that blacks were proud of their city, they were proud of their people, and they would be heard at all costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The parade terminated at the Battle Monument at Fayette and Calvert Streets. Several of the speakers climbed their way onto a scaffold that had been built for the occasion. It collapsed shortly after. Frederick Douglass had been on the platform and, after ascertaining that no one had been hurt, dusted himself off and joked that the platform must have been built by a Democrat (although the Democratic Sun assures us it was built by a Republican). They then went to speak from the balcony of the nearby Gilmor Hotel.”[22]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic reaction against black Republican politics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”No positions under the city government, which has been democratic for years, have been given to colored men. The colored paper which had worked for the democrats, in 1886, remarked, on finding that the 350 nominations sent in by the new mayor were all whites, that surely one colored man could have been found fit to be at least a lamp-lighter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”For some years after emancipation there was a marked movement of blacks from the counties to Baltimore and the larger towns. This has been less of late years, but the city, with its large colored population, prosperous colored churches and societies, attractive social life, and the demand for service, has grown in its colored population far out of proportion to the increase in the counties.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Downtown Baltimore – Civil Rights and Urban Renewal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This tour was most recently modified on 2015 October 6 based on a series of tours of Downtown’s West Side developed in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

Lloyd Lillie, Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;: Born 1932, award-winning sculptor; received a diploma from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and also studied at Skowhegan School of Painting &amp;amp; Sculpture, the Corcoran School of Art, and the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/cfa/profile/a-lloyd-lillie-jr/&quot;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A double portrait of former Baltimore mayor, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., a driving force behind the downtown revitalization of Charles Center. One portrait depicts D’Alesandro casually standing by the side of the plaza looking out over Charles Center. His proper right hand rests on the railing of the plaza and his proper left hand rests on his left trouser pocket. A few feet away, another portrait depicts him relaxing on a park bench with his arms stretched out over the back of the bench. His legs are crossed and he looks over to his proper left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas D’Alesandro died in 1987:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As mayor from 1947 to 1959, D’Alesandro presided over a period of vast physical improvements in Baltimore. An airport was opened outside the city during his tenure, and major league baseball returned to Baltimore.
In 1958, he won voter approval for the financing of the Charles Center urban renewal project, launching the rejuvenation that remade much of the heart of his beloved city. &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-29/news/mn-1349_1_thomas-d-alesandro-jr&quot;&gt;Source.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-charles-center&quot;&gt;About Charles Center&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1954 &lt;/strong&gt;: Committee for Downtown organized to promote a 1000-acre master plan for stopping the commercial decline of downtown/central Baltimore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1955&lt;/strong&gt;: Greater Baltimore Committee, led by banker and developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Rouse&quot; title=&quot;James W. Rouse&quot;&gt;James W. Rouse&lt;/a&gt;, joined the effort. Dissatisfied with the slow pace of public planning, GBC formed an in-house planning team, the Planning Council, headed by nationally-known planner David Wallace from Philadelphia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wallace:&lt;/strong&gt; In Philadelphia, PA in 1953, under Mayor Joseph S. Clark, David Wallace led a citywide urban redevelopment evaluation that resulted in the Central Urban Renewal Area (CURA) Report. The report established a new strategy for overall redevelopment that targeted catalytic actions to strengthen communities and downtown. CURA became a model for Baltimore, MD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 1958:&lt;/strong&gt; Presented a plan to Mayor &amp;amp; City Council calling for office buildings, commercial space, hotels, a theatre, underground parking, etc. Unusual in for incorporating existing structures (not a “clean-slate” design), across a 33 acre site.  Includes three public plazas designed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTKL&quot; title=&quot;RTKL&quot;&gt;RTKL&lt;/a&gt;, connected by walkways and pedestrian bridges. Plan formed the basis of a $25 million bond issue that year. Eventually spent $40 million public funding, $145 million private investment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GBC established an &lt;strong&gt;Architectural Review Board &lt;/strong&gt;: Deans from three of the most prominent architectural schools in the U.S. (Harvard, MIT and University of Pennsylvania) who judged the plans for each parcel of land before development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public benefits: &lt;em&gt;increase in employment&lt;/em&gt; help the city’s economy; &lt;em&gt;increase in tax base&lt;/em&gt; will mean more city resources to meet the needs of the poor. Property development scheme of direct benefit to coporate and finance capital: new downtown employment in skilled or high-paying jobs went to suburban residents, jobs created for city residents are temporary construction or low-paying service sector.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declaring Charles Center the “New Heart of Baltimore,” Jane Jacobs called the project an:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…attempt to stimulate a rebuilding use which is at fundamental odds with previous use or the surroundings of the project. The site is in the very heart of downtown, not on its fringes, and it is to be re-used for precisely the things that belong in the heart of downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1970:&lt;/strong&gt; First City Fair staged at Charles Center
&amp;gt; A pall hung over many city leaders when several of them, including housing commissioner Robert Embry, suggested a city fair at its new Charles Center to celebrate its neighborhoods, ethnic customs, talents and institutional strength.  On the eve of the first fair, fearing that it would set up a riot-prone situation and under pressure from conservatives, D’Alesandro almost canceled it.  However, the fair was held and became an annual event, drawing over a million visitors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;charles-plaza--center-plaza-1958-2007&quot;&gt;Charles Plaza &amp;amp; Center Plaza (1958, 2007)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1958 Charles Center promotional report stated:
&amp;gt; “Here, open space will be used, loved and economically successful because it will be full of pleasant things: fountains, sculpture, flowers, umbrellas, flags, and trees. The open space will be, in its own way, as concentrated as the city around it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Kostritsky of RTKL envisioned an urban landscape of light, sculpture, and water for Charles, Center, and Hopkins plazas. These three plazas, located on the interior of the two superblocks, were to be linked through a series of elevated walkways, escalators and skywalks in order to overcome the problem of the site’s steep topography (a 68-foot drop in grade from the northern boundary of the site to the southern boundary) and to create a series of “pedestrian islands.” Though futuristic in appearance, this circulation system was a typical component of urban design of the 1950s and 60s and was often promoted as a means of separating pedestrians from the automobile traffic. At Charles Center, the exterior circulation system was also intended to provide a venue for extensive retail activity.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not just an office building, but a monument to a revered and influential philosopher -architect will soon rise at Charles and Lexington streets.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer both proposed designs for this site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;23-story aluminum and glass International Style skyscraper, completed in 13 months at a cost of $10,350,000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another developer adapted Breuer’s proposal for a site across the street, and the two buildings came up practically side-by-side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969): &lt;/strong&gt; Started as a teenager Germany working in his father’s stone carving shop. Served as the last director of the Bauhaus architectural school before the Nazis forced the school to close in 1933. Immigrated to Chicago in 1938; best known for midcentury modernist landmarks Farnsworth Building outside of Chicago and the Seagram Building in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1959:&lt;/strong&gt; Kalamazoo, Michigan, became the first American city to adopt an outdoor pedestrian mall designed by Victor Gruen, pioneer in the design of shopping malls, for their downtown area, closing two blocks of Burdick Street to automobile traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1958:&lt;/strong&gt; the Planning Council of the Greater Baltimore Committee advanced a $3,500,000 scheme to create an enclosed air-conditioned mall along Lexington Street. A few years later, Committee for Downtown and the firm of Tatar and Kelly proposed a $1,000,000 “face-lifting” for Lexington Street that would include “an elevated pedestrian level connecting to the second floors of existing buildings.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 1967:&lt;/strong&gt; after earlier abandoning the plan, the Planning Commission was inspired by presentations on successful pedestrian malls in Ottawa, Canada (Sparks Street, 1961) and Knoxville, Tennessee (Market Square, 1950s)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1973: &lt;/strong&gt; Lexington Street between Liberty and Howard closed to all traffic except delivery trucks, despite lawsuit by Gutman Realty (Brager-Gutman)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1984 September 14-16: &lt;/strong&gt; City Fair moved to the Market Center area with events at the Lexington Street pedestrian mall, Lexington Market, Park Avenue’s Chinatown, Center Plaza and more.

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; November 22, 1986:&lt;/strong&gt; ”Some people will like the new arched lamp posts and other street furniture. Others may not.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Some day the romance of the old national road, over which there was once so much traffic should be written. The Conestoga wagon was a vast machine generally painted blue and with a huge white canvas top, and drawn by six or eight magnificent horses hung with bells. There was in the old days an endless line of these to and from the West, each attended by its equipment of teamsters in their white frocks, and filled with goods of various sorts The flour bacon and other things were brought to Baltimore and exchanged for groceries and drygoods. At night in the Spring and Fall, the streets in the neighborhood of the present Lexington Market were blocked up with these equipages.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1888:&lt;/strong&gt; Bank moved across the street, Baltimore Equitable Society moved in and occupied the building until 2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Baltimore Equitable Society&lt;/strong&gt; is the oldest corporation in the city and the third-oldest fire insurance company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Fire Mark” — The Sign of the Clasped Hands, so frequently seen on the exterior of houses in the region, means that the home is (or was) insured by the Baltimore Equitable Society (Baltimore Equitable Insurance).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1904:&lt;/strong&gt; Great Baltimore Fire effected 455 Baltimore Equitable policyholders; the Society incurred losses of nearly $2 million but all policy holders were promptly paid in full.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1896:&lt;/strong&gt; Brewing industry group builds a rhree-story Renaissance Revival style building designed by local architect Joseph Evans Sperry&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joseph Evans Sperry (1854-1930)&lt;/strong&gt;: Native of Georgetown, South Carolina relocated to Baltimore as a young man, also designed Provident Savings Bank and the Emerson “Bromo-Seltzer” Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The façade is faced with terra cotta and includes such decorative elements as two-story half-round Ionic pilasters, cartouches, pediments, window surrounds, a garland frieze, and a balustrade at the edges of a flat roof.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Erected as a center for negotiating commodities used by the brewing industry, the Brewers Exchange has association with this important aspect of Baltimore’s history, though used by the exchange for only a short time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1906:&lt;/strong&gt; The Exchange sold the building to the Mercantile Savings Bank. Building later known also as Murdock Place, when used as offices for urban renewal efforts on the West Side&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Black and Jewish Civil Rights Heritage by Bike</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;1: Overview&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-this-tour-about&quot;&gt;1.1: What is this tour about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tour is about understanding how relationships between Baltimore’s black and Jewish residents shaped the Civil Rights movement and the historic places of northwest Baltimore. Major themes and concepts include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How has housing segregation and employment discrimination shaped the experience of black and Jewish people in Baltimore? How have these factors shaped the development of neighborhoods like Madison Park, Reservoir Hill, Park Circle and Park Heights?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How were Jewish people in Baltimore involved with the Civil Rights movement? Where did this involvement take place and why?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How did Jewish people engage with residents of Baltimore’s historically black neighborhoods?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tour-guide-tips&quot;&gt;1.2: Tour Guide Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet the tour group in front of the Howard P. Rawlings Conservatory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This tour is mostly downhill when riding southeast and uphill when riding northwest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For bike tours, we suggested giving verbal turn by turn directions before setting off at each stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-these-notes&quot;&gt;1.3: About these notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key concepts in each section of the notes have been &lt;strong&gt;marked in bold&lt;/strong&gt;. Large headings separate stops or sections of the tour. We plan to update with information on the estimated amount of time we plan to spend at each stop. Smaller headings separate major concepts within the narrative. These notes are not intended to be read verbatim but are instead meant to inform and guide a tour leader as they respond to the group of participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These notes were prepared by Eli Pousson for a bicycle tour on 2015 October 11. Sites of interest on the tour and vicinity are available as a GeoJSON file that we are planning to turn into an interactive map. Of related interest is our &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/baltimore-civil-rights-heritage/map/&quot;&gt;broader map of Civil Rights associated sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;welcome--introduction&quot;&gt;2: Welcome &amp;amp; Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-jewish-people-live-in-northwest-baltimore&quot;&gt;2.1: Why did Jewish people live in northwest Baltimore?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1825&lt;/strong&gt;: Around 150 Jews lived in Baltimore (according to Solomon Etting) most living in Oldtown and South Baltimore near the harbor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1860s&lt;/strong&gt;: Increasing mobility led members of the Jewish community to move away from the city center to Reservoir Hill and Madison Park/Eutaw Place, near Druid Hill Park. This trend separated more prosperous “uptown” Jews of German descent and less prosperous “downtown” Jews, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1901&lt;/strong&gt;: A group of wealthy Jews, mostly German descent, established the &lt;strong&gt;Suburban Club&lt;/strong&gt; in the Park Heights corridor between Druid Ridge Cemetery and the northwestern city line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built for $200,000, the &lt;strong&gt;Suburban Club&lt;/strong&gt; required substantial dues and that members contribute a certain amount of money annually to Jewish charities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1910s-40s&lt;/strong&gt;: Pattern of Jewish migration was complex; Liberty Road, Reisterstown Road, and Park Heights Avenue all major corridors. Development Expansion along the Park Heights corridor took place in several stages in the early 20th century. Forest Park and Park Heights both attracted many middle-class Jewish homebuyers were. Neighborhoods closer to Druid Hill Park are largely rowhouse districts; close the city line or beyond are largely detached homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deed restrictions and racial covenants&lt;/strong&gt; excluded both Jewish and African American Baltimoreans from purchasing property in neighborhoods developed by the Roland Park Company and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-african-americans-see-jews-how-did-jews-see-african-americans&quot;&gt;2.2: How did African Americans see Jews? How did Jews see African Americans?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1860s&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Dr. David Einhorn&lt;/strong&gt;, Baltimore rabbi, preached abolitionism in pro-slavery Baltimore, made his journal &lt;em&gt;Sinai&lt;/em&gt; an organ for the movement, left Baltimore for Philadelphia to avoid mob violence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1900&lt;/strong&gt;: Before WWI, Baltimore had proportionally the largest Jewish population of any Southern city; larger black population than any northern city&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1909&lt;/strong&gt;: In New York, blacks and Jews cooperated in founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1930s-40s&lt;/strong&gt;: Black and white lawyers worked on civil rights lawsuits throughout the South, honing the skills and arguments men such as Thurgood Marshall would put to use in the landmark cases of the 1950’s, and into the 1960’s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1960s&lt;/strong&gt;:  Rise of black power in the 60’s and differences among blacks and Jews over affirmative action as key developments that drove a wedge into the coalition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the Civil Rights Movement, Jewish activists represented a disproportionate number of whites involved in the struggle. Jews made up half of the young people who participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964. Leaders of the Reform Movement were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations. Most famously, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in his 1965 March on Selma.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”I would say that […] the Jews are white people with all the white people’s psychology and prejudices when it comes to dealing with Negroes.”
— Morgan State University President  [?] talking about Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 1900s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some labor activists compared Jewish industrial workers to new American slaves who “took [the] place of the Negroes who with great effort had won their freedom from slavery.” […] The Arbeiter Setung attacked employers in Baltimore for demanding character references from previous bosses. “Are we in dark Asiatic Russia or in free America?” inquired the reporter.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;druid-hill-park&quot;&gt;3: Druid Hill Park&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-druid-hill-park-develop&quot;&gt;3.1: How did Druid Hill Park develop?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1860&lt;/strong&gt;: Druid Hill Park established on the former country estate of Lloyd Rogers. Later developed with elaborate gardens, lakes, trails &amp;amp; sculptures &amp;amp; now contains the Maryland Zoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;druid-hill-park-tennis-courts&quot;&gt;3.2: Druid Hill Park Tennis Courts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Discrimination against the Negro people means discrimination against Jews, Catholics and all minorities. Segregation is a policy used to divide people and results in inferior living conditions and recreational facilities for all.
—Stanley Askin, July 1948&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1943 July 17&lt;/strong&gt;: Dallas F. Nicholas contacts Baltimore Board of Recreation and Parks for all-black Baltimore Tennis Club calling for an end to the segregation of courts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1948&lt;/strong&gt;: Young Progressives of Maryland, a political group of college-aged men and women in Baltimore, joined with the black Baltimore Tennis Club to stage a protest of Druid Hill Park’s segregated tennis facilities, cries of communism were immediate:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The interracial game was planned and advertised, but stopped by police before any actual play could take place. All of the players were arrested, along with several spectators who were heard to yell, “This is Nazi Germany! Why can’t they play? They’re 33 American citizens!” As they were arrested, the protestors began singing songs like “America, the Beautiful,” “My Country ‘Tis of Thee,” and the Negro National Anthem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Askin&lt;/strong&gt; was a twice-wounded leader of a Ranger battalion in the D-Day landing at Normandy, later said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Segregation, we reasoned, was indefensible. Many of those who agreed with us were Jewish. Early on we had learned that if you scratch a racist, you often uncover an anti-Semite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historian Deb Weiner writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; In July 1948 young Jewish leftists took part in an early civil rights protest featuring the nonviolent civil disobedience that would soon come to characterize the movement. The interracial Young Progressives of Maryland (a branch of the Progressive Party) joined with the all-black Baltimore Tennis Club to hold an interracial tennis match at segregated Druid Hill Park in front of an enthusiastic, racially mixed crowd of supporters. When police insisted that the players quit the clay courts, “the contestants sat or lay down on the ground and refused to move,” reported the Sun. “Most were lifted bodily and placed in patrol wagons.” About thirteen blacks and ten whites were arrested, at least eight Jewish. Most of the charges were dropped though some of the organizers were convicted of conspiracy and received suspended sentences, including tennis player Stanley Askin and state Progressive Party chair Harold Buchman. (Both would soon be targeted by HUAC for their political activities; Askin was blacklisted from his radio career and never quite recovered. Buchman would reemerge as an activist attorney whose clients included the Catonsville Nine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pool-no-2&quot;&gt;3.3: Pool No. 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1921&lt;/strong&gt;: “Pool No. 2” built in to meet the recreational and competitive swimming needs of all of Baltimore’s African Americans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pool No. 2 measured just 100’ x 105’ (half the size of whites-only Pool No. 1), but proved so popular that the swimmers had to be admitted in shifts. Pool No. 1, connected directly to the reservoir, supplied swimmers with unfiltered water; Pool No. 2 had filters installed to “de-negroize” the water, ensure the “safety” of the rest of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Inadvertently, this offensive policy resulted in a better experience for African-Americans. Scott succinctly states, “What was seen as a way of restraining someone only made them stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Population (1920)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Public Pools&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;People/pool&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;White&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;618,695&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6 pools&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;103,116&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Black&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;115,129&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1 pool&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;115,129&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;733,824&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7 pools&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;104,832&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1953&lt;/strong&gt;: when an African-American boy accidentally drowned while swimming with friends in the Patapsco River. He lived near Clifton Park but was not allowed to swim in the park’s whites-only pool. For this reason it was thought that he chose to swim in the dangerous river feeding Baltimore Harbor’s Middle Branch. As a result, the NAACP pushed for all Baltimore municipal pools to be opened to all races. When the Parks Board refused, the NAACP filed a lawsuit, which they eventually won on appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1956 June 23&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore pools open for the summer on a non-segregated basis; over 100 African-Americans reportedly braved the waters in Pool No. 1; only one white person swam in Pool. No. 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1957&lt;/strong&gt;: Pool No. 2 is closed in an “effort to eliminate all vestiges of the city’s former “separate but equal” swimming infrastructure.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1999&lt;/strong&gt;: Memorial Pool created by Baltimore artist Joyce J. Scott, who asked, “How do we make this area useful and beautiful, and harken back to the pool era?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation Issue&lt;/strong&gt;: “In addition to the architectural framing devices and aquatic symbolism, the original installation included abstract, colorful painted designs on the pavement around the pool that have since faded from the concrete surface and disappeared due to time and weather.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;madison-park-and-eutaw-place&quot;&gt;4: Madison Park and Eutaw Place&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-eutaw-place-develop-in-the-late-1800s-how-did-the-area-become-african-american-in-the-1920s-30s&quot;&gt;4.1: How did Eutaw Place develop in the late 1800s? How did the area become African American in the 1920s-30s?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1853 March 19&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore City accepts Eutaw Place as a gift Henry Tiffany, requiring Tiffany to build “not less than seven houses of not less than twenty five feet front and three stories high” in exchange for park improvements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1876 May 23&lt;/strong&gt;: Northern end of Eutaw Place moved from Laurens Street (limit of Tiffany property) to North Avenue, perimeter railing removed around this time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1883-1886&lt;/strong&gt;: Woodrow Wilson, lived at 1208 Eutaw Place, while working on a Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1888&lt;/strong&gt;: John Thomas Scharf, who lived nearby in Lafayette Square, wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Artistic gardening the highest character has exhausted its resources beautifying these squares and it may be said exaggeration that they form one of the most specimens of street parking to be found anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;late 1870s&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Bottom” around Biddle Alley, bounded by Biddle Street, Argyle Avenue, Druid Hill Avenue, North Avenue, city’s 17th ward&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1904&lt;/strong&gt;: ½ of Baltimore’s black population lived in the neighborhood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-royal-theatre&quot;&gt;4.2: The Royal Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All of the biggest stars in black entertainment, including those in jazz and blues, performed at the Royal. Ethel Waters debuted there, as did Pearl Bailey, who sang in a chorus line. Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller worked as accompanists. Singer Louis Jordan, Duke Ellington, The Tympany Five, Etta James, Nat King Cole, The Platters, The Temptations, and The Supremes, as well as a 40-piece, all-female band touring with Count Basie called the Sweethearts of Rhythm, were all performers at the Royal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1971&lt;/strong&gt;: Royal Theater was demolished&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2004&lt;/strong&gt;: Royal Theater Monument erected after a seven-year effort by  Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Collaborative (PARC), working with the Mayor’s Office, Upton Planning Committee, and 14 community groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jazz Singer premiere, “Jazz Indebted to the Jews”&lt;/p&gt;

- In HS went to Park Heights, became a song-writer, go around to all the black clubs to try to sell her songs, hooked up with &lt;strong&gt;The Orioles&lt;/strong&gt; - her song is a smash hit, she became their manager
- It’s too soon to know, 1948 (landmark Rhythm )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gerry Lieber (Baltimore) and Mike Stoller (NYC)&lt;/strong&gt; (from Baltimore) and Mike Stoller (from NYC)
- Gerry grew up in a black neighborhood, lived about his family store
- His mother owned a store, delivered goods would hear black music on the radios of homes where he made deliveries, moved to California, wrote you ain’t nothing but a hound dog, first a hit for black music before, stand by me with Ben King&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1324 Druid Hill Avenue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-time home of Juanita Carroll Jackson and Clarence Mitchell Sr. Building was stabilized and re-roofed by the city in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1936&lt;/strong&gt;: Wedding attended by 1500 people at Sharp Street Church, old high school classmate Anne Wiggins (singer for Porgy and Bess).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1942&lt;/strong&gt;: Moved to Druid Hill rowhouse, the same year Clarence starts working at the &lt;strong&gt;FEPC&lt;/strong&gt;. Went on to raise five sons and live at the house until the end of their lives, visitors included Paul Robeson, Duke Ellington, Marian Anderson, Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1956&lt;/strong&gt;: “From time we were kids we were recruited for mass meetings, for handing out fliers. In 1956 my parents were hosting Hungarian freedom fighters” and fed them tuna sandwiches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1960&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Mitchell picks up phone / “This is John Kennedy. Is your father home?” / “He’s at work.” / “Is your mother there?” / She’s in the bathroom.” / Olesker: “Young Michael never heard the end of that one.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Michael Olesker interviewed Dr. Kieffer Mitchell:  what his parents would have thought of the condition of their former home: “My parents wouldn’t have cared about that. They didn’t care about bricks and mortar. My parents were revolutionaries.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEPC was established to enforce Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802 banning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarence worked at the FEPC from 1942 until 1946 when the FEPC was dissolved, then joined the staff of the NAACP. “Jewish groups were among the FEPC’s earliest supporters, a number of FEPC staff members were Jews; Jewish organizations forwarded complaints to the FEPC and were among the prime initiators of FEPC efforts to remove religious questions from employment applications and personnel and security investigations of applicants.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn4v5HoKM5cC&amp;amp;lpg=PR147&amp;amp;ots=stn4JOye6f&amp;amp;dq=clarence%20mitchell%20jewish&amp;amp;pg=PR144#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=clarence%20mitchell%20jewish&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1943 March&lt;/strong&gt;: Mitchell wrote to Theodore A. Jones, “Material to be submitted for War Manpower Commission report”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There has been some improvement in the over-all employment of minority groups in industry but there is still a [widespread] tendency to confine Negros to unskilled jobs and to exclude altogether [Negro women and] persons who are Jewish or aliens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the Jewish experience in America and Europe influence the Civil Rights struggle? How did Jews support the Civil Rights movement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During WWII, the  &lt;em&gt;Afro American&lt;/em&gt; and other voices advocated against discrimination in Baltimore be comparing it to fascism in Europe. Tactic was used in the Orchids &amp;amp; Onions campaign to stop discrimination against black shoppers at downtown department stores. Onions included the May Company, Stewart’s Department Store, and Hutzler’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963) echoes Juanita Jackson Mitchell’s argument in &lt;em&gt;State v. Bell&lt;/em&gt;  (1960) reflects on important parallels between Jewish and African American struggle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was “legal” and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was “illegal.” It was “illegal” to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s Germany.’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joseph L. Rauh Jr.,&lt;/strong&gt; a Jewish lawyer from Washington, DC, who worked 40 years for the NAACP, worked closely with Clarence Mitchell. Rauh recalled Senator Harry Byrd Sr. of Virginia railing on the Senate floor railing against a civil rights bill on which  Rauh and Clarence Mitchell Sr., worked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clarence and I were in the gallery and Byrd suddenly gestured to us as he spoke from the Senate floor and said: ‘There they are. The Golddust Twins,’ ‘’ he recalled. ‘‘It was the happiest moment of my life.’’ —&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/us/jews-and-blacks-recall-the-decades-of-partnership.html&quot;&gt;NYT, 1988&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1900&lt;/strong&gt;: the twins had been transformed into a cartoonish pair of caricature, bald, asexual black children shown wearing tutus emblazoned with the words “Gold” and “Dust”.
&lt;strong&gt;1929&lt;/strong&gt;: “The Gold Dust Twins” radio program first broadcast nationally; starred Harvey Hindemeyer and Earle Tuckerman as “Goldy” and “Dusty”, respectively, sponsored by Lever Brothers and Gold Dust Washing Powder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1787&lt;/strong&gt;: Sharp Street Church established, the first African American Methodist congregation in Baltimore City&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1797&lt;/strong&gt;: blacks gathered at 112-116 Sharp Street, where the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery had opened the Baltimore African Academy, the city’s first prominent day school for blacks. The Society later abandoned this project and sold the lot and building in 1802 to the black congregation, which then built a church on the property, first building occupied by the congregation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1846&lt;/strong&gt;: Church hosted the first regional conference for black methodists, leading to the first appointment of black pastors and creation of a black governing board. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1898&lt;/strong&gt;: Following its congregation into northwest Baltimore, the church erected the present building designed by Alphonsus Bieler. Bieler lived at 1021 McCulloh, also designed church for Macedonian Baptist on Saratoga at Vincent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1921&lt;/strong&gt;: Black architect Arthur M. Segoin designed the adjacent Community House&lt;/li&gt;

Israel was very involved in black-white cooperation efforts through the Citywide Young People’s Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Famously wrote an article for &lt;em&gt;The Crisis&lt;/em&gt; about anti-semitism he encountered at the Young People’s Forum, followed by a response from Lillie Mae Jackson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1853&lt;/strong&gt;: Founded as a middle of the road congregation between the Reform Har Sinai and Orthodox Baltimore Hebrew&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19th century:&lt;/strong&gt; Congregation is led by Rabbi Benjamin Szold, father of Henrietta Szold, who supported Lincoln in Baltimore; became a leader in the Baltimore Association for the Education and Moral Improvement of Colored People after the Civil War; critics vilified and labeled him the Rabbi of “Timbuctoo”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purchased by Prince Hall Masons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1784&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore’s Prince Hall Lodge on Eutaw Street traces its origins to New England in, where Prince Hall, the father of black Masonry in the United States, is credited with making it possible for African Americans to become Masons.&lt;/li&gt;

Allen as Grand Master, the Grand Lodge moved to Eutaw Place at Lanvale Street, Temple named after Allen&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samuel T. Daniels&lt;/strong&gt; raised on Druid Hill Avenue, he was a 1940 graduate of Frederick Douglass High School and earned a bachelor’s degree in education from what is now Coppin State University. In 1958, he was named executive secretary of the Baltimore Community Relations Commission and simultaneously worked for Baltimore Municipal Employees Local 44 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Mr. Daniels paid travel expenses so that young civil rights advocates could attend the 1965 marches in Selma, Alabama. Daniels died in 2005, spent 20 years as executive director of the Baltimore Council for Equal Business Opportunity, a private organization that encouraged black participation in business,  appointed to city school board in December 1968. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1975&lt;/strong&gt;: President Ford appointed Saltzman to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. In 1983, President Reagan fired Saltzman and two other commission members for criticizing his administration’s policies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1978&lt;/strong&gt;: Salesman moves from Indianapolis to Baltimore to become rabbi at Baltimore Hebrew Congregation.

Jackson, known as the mother of the civil rights movement, rose to become a national leader in the movement: she sponsored the “Buy Where You Can Work” campaign to promote integrated businesses and boycott segregated ones (1931); she launched Baltimore’s NAACP branch (1935); she began a movement to register black voters and shift in city politics (1942); and she was central to Baltimore’s integration after the landmark Brown v.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1621 Bolton Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1908 July 25&lt;/strong&gt;: Walter Sondheim, Jr. born in Baltimore, grows up at 1621 Bolton Street. Later quoted in the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[…] Mr. Sondheim has not escaped feeling the effects of bigotry in his own life, but “I can’t say in any way that it was ever really disabling. I don’t think that you can grow up in our society and not be conscious of the fact that you’re Jewish. There was much more bigotry when I grew up than there is now. For example in Baltimore I remember when Mrs. Sondheim and I were married in 1934, when we were looking for an apartment she came home shocked one night because she had found someplace that she wanted and was told she could not rent it because we were Jews. And I have felt strongly about some of the club discrimination in Baltimore, particularly the non-social clubs. But I think the important things in this area have changed, and it’s nice to have lived in a time when this has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sondheim spent 41 years working for Hochshild Kohn, ending as senior vice president and treasurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1954&lt;/strong&gt;: A cross was burned on the lawn of Walter Sondheim at his Alto Road home in Windsor Hills (later recalled as a “puny little cross”).
&lt;strong&gt;1957&lt;/strong&gt;: Walter Sondheim leaves the school board to take a position as the first head of the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Commission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sondheim on the success of urban renewal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think some of the principal successes were some of the things we learned by making mistakes. And one of the biggest things we learned was that you have to avoid the tendency to know what’s good for people. I think it’s a lesson we learned fairly quickly in residential areas, and Harlem Park is the best example. We went in and started to decide what ought to be done in the Harlem Park area, and we soon learned that you don’t do it that way. People want to have something to say about their own fortunes and their own futures.”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gail, a tobacco firm owner, Rob’t Whitelock (Whitlelock Street), and Enoch Pratt Carroll. Carroll’s tract was known as &lt;strong&gt;Callow Grove&lt;/strong&gt; (later Callow Ave.), a famous picnic area with a spring located in the 2100 block of Bolton Street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1840s&lt;/strong&gt;: Development begins moving north, wealthy Baltimoreans build large three &amp;amp; four story homes, churches&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; 1896&lt;/strong&gt;: After streets widened, paved in the 1880s, all of Mount Royal Royal had been sold or developed, except the area surrounding the mansion house.&lt;/li&gt;

Kohn. Max Hoschild died June 1, 1957 at age 102 lived in the Emersonian Apartments, kept an office at the downtown store from his retirement up through shortly before 1957&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Civil Rights and Jewish-owned Department Stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1938&lt;/strong&gt;: After meeting with department store owners, Walter White of the NAACP lamented the situation, where the nine largest department stores, seven owned by Jews refused African American customers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Justify it on the ground that they might lose some white trade if they stopped discriminating against Negroes. One of the leading Jewish department store heads even became offended because I very mildly pointed out the parallel between what Hitler was doing to Jews in Germany and what Jewish and Gentile merchants were doing to another minority group right here in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1939 January&lt;/strong&gt;: AJC published a report titled “The Truth About Baltimore”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;”Objectively, there are Jewish owned stores that accept Negro customers and Christian owned stores that do no. However, there can be no doubt that most of the blame for the situation is placed on the Jews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;NCJW, in Baltimore, while the AJC and ADL defended the racist practices of Jewish store owners, Jewish women organized petition drives as shoppers to urge a change of policy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (c. 1956?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite unconscious paternalism of much of Jewish involvement in the Black civil rights struggle, and never disputing that working for Black civil rights often proved of direct benefit to Jews, these women and men continued to understand their commitment in terms of Judaism’s universalist ethics.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garvey spoke at Bethel AME Church on December 18, 1918: “The war has brought about a change. It has driven men of all races to be more selfish, and Negroes, I think Negroes of the world have been observing, have been watching&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kivie Kaplan, a vice-chairman of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism), served as the national president of the NAACP from 1966 to 1975. Arnie Aronson worked with A. Philip Randolph and Roy Wilkins to found the Leadership Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 1910 to 1940, more than 2,000 primary and secondary schools and twenty black colleges (including Howard, Dillard and Fisk universities) were established in whole or in part by contributions from Jewish philanthropist. At the height of the so-called “Rosenwald schools,” nearly forty percent of southern blacks were educated at one of these institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were drafted in the conference room of Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, under the aegis of the Leadership Conference, which for decades was located in the RAC’s building. The Jewish community has continued its support of civil rights laws addressing persistent discrimination in voting, housing and employment against not only women and people of color but also in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community and the disabled community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltimore was the only city at the beginning of the 20th century that had large Jewish and black populations in the whole country; the only place that both groups made up a substantial portion of the congregation, affected how they interacted with each other. NYC and Philadelphia still just 1-2% before WWI; not absolutely

&lt;p&gt;The Price of Whiteness: how Jews became white&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Edward Israel, Har Sinais in the 1920s, the social justice rabbi, the only one who would say that the department stores needed to desegregation, Hutzler family was one of the founders in the 1840s, Albert Hutzler was a congregant, very involved in black-white cooperation efforts, almost a socialist, Citywide Young People’s Forum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went to the young people forum, He wrote an article about anti-semitism for The Crisis
Jewish Rabbi Edward Israel,
Liberal Jews in the
Sharp Street Church, Lillie Mae Jackson responded with the department store thing, NAACP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Park Heights: 90% in 1960, 90% black in 1970 — Jewish participation in white flight&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Vacant Houses by Bike: Salvage, Demolish or Preserve?</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; These tour notes were prepared in July/August 2015 by Eli Pousson for &lt;a href=&quot;http://baltimoreheritage.org/event/vacant-houses-preservation-demolition-renewal-bike/&quot;&gt;Vacant Houses by Bike: Vacant Houses by Bike: Salvage, Demolish or Preserve?&lt;/a&gt; – a bike tour program organized by Baltimore Heritage on August 9. They are presented here in their rough form including extended from a variety of publications. We hope to revise and expand these notes if we repeat this tour in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a problem with vacant houses in Baltimore. A vacant might be a bank-owned brick townhouse from the 1970s; a narrow two-story rowhouse built for working-class whites in the 1910s; or a four-story 1870s mansion half-collapsed into the basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltimore City estimates the city holds around 16,000 vacant properties — mostly attached rowhouses built before WWII. The U.S. Census Bureau has found 46,800 vacant homes — 16 percent of Baltimore’s housing stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homesteading in Otterbein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986&lt;/strong&gt;: NYT reported –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the 1970’s the city sold blocks of abandoned Federal-style row houses in downtown neighborhoods for $1 apiece and provided buyers with up to $37,000 in low-interest construction loans. The city provided technical assistance and authorized payments to approved contractors. Major work had to be completed within six months and, after 18 months in residency, homesteaders received the deeds to the houses. Baltimore’s homesteading program, for example, brought only 600 houses back to life during the 10-year program. By comparison, 40,000 families are on a nine-year waiting list for Baltimore’s 20,000 units of public housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Federal budget reductions, starting in 1980, forced the city to stop subsidizing construction loans - and now city officials said it has run out of the sort of salvageable properties that appeal to homesteaders. In the 1982 program, Rehab Express, the city simply sold boarded-up houses around the city for $100 or $200 apiece and buyers were responsible for obtaining financing and working with contractors. Of the 300 homesteaders in this program, only about 64 managed to secure financing and complete their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salvage and rehabilitation in South Baltimore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1974, the Baltimore Sun profiled preservationist Jane Springer under the headline, “Transformed - a 14 foot wide rowhouse.” Springer volunteered as a member of the Preservation Society board of directors and used architectural elements from vacant buildings to rehabilitate an 1802 Federal Hill rowhouse on Montgomery Street. She remarked to the Baltimore Sun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**“I didn’t want to use new materials in renovating an old house,” **said Mrs. Springer. “I got permission from the Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation at City Hall to remove from vacant houses owned by the city pieces of old wood, the stairway; the large-paned mullioned windows (on the second and third floor rear) from an abandoned plant and the iron balustrade across the front exterior. The commission stipulates that such materials be used only for renovations in a restoration area; they cannot be bought for re-sale. The expense involved is in the removal and hauling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the efforts of a group of similar home rehabbers contributed to the establishment of the Baltimore Salvage Depot, an enterprise touted in 1981 as “the country’s first center for recycling urban architectural artifacts.” Supported in part by federal workforce training grants, the depot offered a wide range of products at a Pratt Street warehouse in the early 1980s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A pair of Olympic torches from the old Oriole Park on 29th street, oak doors from St. Mary’s Seminary, and stained glass windows from an East Baltimore rowhouse–it’s all gathered in the dark and dingy five-story warehouse at 213 West Pratt street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sign out front reads “The Baltimore Salvage Depot,” a distinctly unpretentious title for an operation described as the country’s first center for recycling urban architectural artifacts… Now in its sixth year, the Salvage Depot was established to recycle items taken from condemned city-owned houses and buildings. The idea began when homesteaders, seeing salvageable sections of houses being buried under the rubble or a wrecker’s ball, used to go scrounging in vacant houses after the wrecking crew quit for the day. This practice was not only hazardous, but illegal. For once the property was turned over to the wreckers, it was privately owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Upscale ambitions for Pigtown ; Renewal: City investment aims to draw developers into a Washington Village renaissance.: [FINAL Edition] Rosen, Jill. The Sun [Baltimore, Md] 26 Jan 2005: 1B:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most people look at derelict properties as a public-safety liability,” said Jack Danna, Washington Boulevard Main Street Program manager. “What they really are is an economic development issue.”&lt;/strong&gt; …
For more than four years the community hoped to shame wayward property owners into fixing or selling their buildings by nagging code enforcement officers to write citation after citation on them. Despite a long list of violations, it hasn’t worked.
“The problem of houses sitting in the middle of the block that the landlord won’t fix up and won’t sell - that’s the biggest problem in Pigtown,” said longtime resident Bus Chambers, adding that the blight has a tendency to spread. “It’s like two bad teeth in your mouth - if you let it go, next thing you know you’ve got three decaying.” At the end of their rope, community leaders said they turned to eminent domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can you solve vacant housing with &lt;strong&gt;*_homeowner assistance_&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?* “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1974&lt;/strong&gt;: Robert C. Embry remarked, &lt;strong&gt;“There is nothing like a boarded-up house to pull down a whole block,” the Sun called it a “truism echoed by landlords and residents.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;: The Abell Foundation grants Jubilee Baltimore and Baltimore Heritage $50,000 to support a pilot partnership providing community outreach and technical rehabilitation assistance to homeowners and buyers in the Marble Hill, Station North, and Hollins Market neighborhoods. Baltimore Heritage provides small group workshops on the historic renovation process and facilitates access to state and city historic tax benefits; Jubilee Baltimore will offer a full program of renovation assistance, developing the scope of work, finding a contractor, overseeing the construction process, and helping to obtain financing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008&lt;/strong&gt;: Sally Otto (Jubilee Baltimore) helped 30 property owners in the Union Square-Hollins Market secure historic tax credits&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*What is a market gap? What is a subsidy required to redevelop vacant houses?**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008&lt;/strong&gt;: Jubilee Baltimore renovated three formerly vacant derelict houses overlooking the Hollins Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2009&lt;/strong&gt;: Home values fell from prices when Jubilee Baltimore arranged construction financing.  Based on market comparables, each house appraised for $40,000 less than the cost to build them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2014&lt;/strong&gt;: DHCD forgives $495,000 in loans through Community Legacy program that supported the purchase/rehab of 12 vacant homes in Penn North, Eutaw Place/Madison Avenue, and Hollins Market Historic Districts, noting “Although the overall impact has met the revitalization outcomes anticipated, the financial outcomes are below projections due to the economic downturn.” In Hollins Market, the 2014 conditions were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development Cost: $858,000;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessed Value: $330,000;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community Legacy: $180,000;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;edward-d-preston-residence---1637-edmondson-avenue&quot;&gt;Edward D. Preston Residence - 1637 Edmondson avenue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When did we start using demolition to solve our vacant house problem? As City Building Inspector, Edward Dawson Preston became the first to declare “War on Unsafe Buildings” in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 12, 1900&lt;/strong&gt;: THEIR HUMBLE HOME UNSAFE: Mr. And Mrs. Henry Unkelback Fear They May Be Turned Out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Burned with the fear that they may be made homeless are an old couple who occupy the dwelling 907 West Saratoga street, which has been condemned as unsafe by Building Inspector Preston. The couple are Mr. and Mrs. Henry Unkelback and for more than 30 years they have lived in the house which they now fear they may be compelled to abandon.
The house is two stories high and was probably built more than half a century ago.
…In better days Mr. Unkelback owned the little house. He became poorer as he grew older, and when he was unable to pay the taxes on the house it was sold by the city. Mr. Unkelback says he does not know who purchased the house, but had heard the purchaser was involved in a legal fight in the courts with the owner of the ground. He had hoped that he would be allowed undisputable possession of the house until after the lawsuit had been settled.
Building Inspector Preston is determined, however, that the walls of the house must come down. If the owner of it declines to make the house secure the Building Inspector will likely have the work done and then sue the owner for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 1901&lt;/strong&gt;: Preston continues a campaign of condemning “unsafe” buildings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mr. Preston said yesterday he was determined to clean Baltimore of buildings such as this, which are a menace to public safety, and since his incumbency as Buildings Inspector he has condemned about 1,500 altogether.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 1904:&lt;/strong&gt; Preston helped to shape changes to city building laws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“An ordinance changing the building laws of the city… introduced in both branches of the City Council… after consultation with a number of prominent builders and architects, and is designed to remedy the defects in the present laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effort continued in 1906, “The City Council can make or mar the best building regulator ever compiled for a municipality, according to Building Inspector Preston. As the proposed laws now stand they are said to be inadequate in some instances and too strenuous in others. If a happy medium is met, it is the opinion of Mr. Preston that Baltimore will have the most up-to-date building code of any city in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 21, 1907&lt;/strong&gt;: MR. PRESTON ALARMED: Says Tailors And Shoemakers Try To Remodel Buildings,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I was astounded at the carelessness with which buildings were being remodeled in East Baltimore,” Mr. Preston said. The foreign population which has crowded in the section called the ghetto employ tailors and shoemakers to build houses. The owner of the house on High street who was killed was a tailor, yet he had torn out an end wall and was reconstructing the building. One of the inspectors of this department ordered him to stop work on the building and put in more props a short time before the collapse…
There should be a law requiring builders to be licensed as plumbers are. As the law now is, we can’t refuse a man a building permit because he is incompetent to erect a building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1941&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore Hygiene of Housing  ordinance gives City Health Department greater power for nuisance abatement, start of the City Housing Code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1943&lt;/strong&gt;: Housing Division established within the Health Department, 1949 becomes the Office of Housing and Law Enforcement and in 1951, Housing Bureau of the Health Department, creates the “Baltimore Plan”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dec 6, 1981&lt;/strong&gt;: Vacant houses an ‘insurmaounble’ problem for neighbors (Baltimore Sun):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are 6,142 addresses on the city’s latest list of abandoned houses. The number changes slightly every year, but despite a variety of official efforts to alleviate the situation through prosecution rehabilitation and sales, it has remained about the same for a long time.
In recent weeks, city officials have been meeting with groups of property investors to try to find new solutions to this perpetual problem. Last week, a City Council hearing was held to discuss more effective marketing of the several thousand vacant properties the city has acquired because of unpaid property taxes, and this month the Citizens Planning and Housing Agency has begun a comprehensive study of abandonment…
Since late 1979, city officials have been suing landlords who do not pay property taxes, a policy that has made some miscreants think twice about taking what was formerly known as “the easy way out”–simply letting the city take the house. But it has hardly proven the perfect cure…
For city officials, the trick always has been to rehabilitate vacant houses that can act as catalysts to turn back that “moving edge” of blight. In some cases–such as the cooperative the city created from whole blocks of largely vacant houses in three neighborhoods–the tactic seems to have worked.
But in other cases–such as the Vacant House Program (VHP), in which 1,900 scattered, abandoned rowhouses have been renovated as public housing since 1972–the jury is still out on whether they will become “seeds of revitalization” or be swallowed up by the stronger forces of decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stricker-street&quot;&gt;900-1000 Stricker Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vacants to Value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streamline the Disposition of City-Owned Properties&lt;/em&gt; - Through reorganization, increased marketing, and improvement of pricing policy, we are making the sale of city- owned properties a clear, predictable, and transparent process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Streamline Code Enforcement in Stronger Markets *- Through streamlined code enforcement we are forcing scattered vacants in otherwise strong neighborhoods to rehabilitation without ever going to court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demolish and Maintain Severely Distressed Blocks&lt;/em&gt; - Recognizing that not every vacant building can be revitalized, were also using targeted demolition, land banking, and active promotion of creative non-housing uses to support long-term housing value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore receives  $10 million from national mortgage fraud settlement, dedicates nearly all to demolition - in strategic demolition clusters; preservation review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014&lt;/strong&gt;: Vacant to Value markets 900-1000 Stricker Street with Surplus Property Sale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“These 22, three-story, large-body row houses provides the perfect opportunity to create an attractive development site, and a make positive change in this neighborhood. The homes have great access to public transportation and are close to an award-winning primary school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;strong&gt;strategic demolition&lt;/strong&gt;? Blight elimination? According to the Shrinking Cities Studio:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A key element of the shrinking cities problem is an excess of housing stock in communities without much demand for housing. One of the solutions being currently promoted is strategic demolition, in which abandoned or substandard properties are demolished. This reduces the impact of substandard properties on the image and property values of struggling communities, eliminates nodes of environmental nuisances or crime and frees lands for new uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modern-junk--salvage-company---1423-n-fremont-avenue&quot;&gt;Modern Junk &amp;amp; Salvage Company - 1423 N Fremont Avenue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1795&lt;/strong&gt;: Patrick Colquhoun’s &lt;em&gt;Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis&lt;/em&gt; (London) he calls out “The Dealers in Old Iron and other Metal” as a trade that includes a significant proportion of “criminal Receivers; who purchase everything that is offered in the way of trade; well knowing, from the price and other circumstances, that the property was originally stolen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 1887&lt;/strong&gt;: two men were arrested for a campaign of metal theft in vacant homes in the neighborhood of what was then the city’s far western border:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For several weeks past unoccupied houses in the neighborhood of Lexington street and Fulton avenue have been successfully entered, and the copper lining in bath-tubs, gas brackets, globes and lead pipe have been stolen. No clue could be obtained to the thieves.”
Neighbors spotted two men pair “entering the unoccupied dwelling No. 1819 Lexington street, belonging to the Garrett estate, with intent to steal,” and after an “An Exciting Chase and Arrest,” (including an attempted rooftop escape) the police caught “Wm. Thomas and Charles Griffin, both colored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 1916&lt;/strong&gt;: Baltimore Sun reported on the Big Sums in Junk Trade,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The junk men are the real dealers in futures. They are optimists of the highest type. They “feed on: the worn-out and decadent. They see value in every scrap of waste or rust-scaled metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junk shop operating at this location since at least 1943, building used as a stable in early 1900s. In the mid-1960s, owned by brothers S. Louis Weinstein and Joseph Weinstein; in 1980s, owned by Joe Brightman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;:  130 light poles stolen for scrap aluminum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lynn Smith, the manager at the Modern Junk and Salvage Company in Baltimore, said the thieves’ quest for quick cash did not surprise her. “They find any way they can to get the metal and then the money in Baltimore,” Ms. Smith said. “They don’t care how they get it.” She added that she and other local dealers in scrap metal were “on alert” for sections of aluminum light poles and would not buy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt;: Growth in metal theft from high copper prices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re beginning to paint our copper wire green in order to make it evident when it shows up at the reclamation site that that’s where it came from,” said BGE spokesman Ken DeFontes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mcculloh-street&quot;&gt;1805 McCulloh Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 1881&lt;/strong&gt;: the police asked local families to report their travel plans to local authorities creating what is likely the city’s earliest formal inventory of vacant buildings, as the Sun reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This summer the exodus from Baltimore has been greater than usual, and there are probably some twelve or thirteen hundred houses vacant, mainly in the north and northwestern sections of the city. The protection of this property is left to the police, and how to preserve it intact has been a matter of careful consideration by the police authorities. Notifications that the families have removed are generally sent to Police Marshal Gray or to the captains of districts with requests that the houses be looked after.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1897&lt;/strong&gt;: concern over “Vacant House Robberies” led Baltimore police officers to patrol in “citizen dress” to try to catch thieves in the act. Baltimore Police Captain Solomon Freeburger offered a number of creative ideas as a solution including a plan to place younger officers in the neighborhoods with the greatest number of vacant homes, noting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the residential parts of the city where there are great numbers of vacant houses, it would be well to place the young men who are active and alert. Daily inspection of all property left for the summer is practiced at present in this city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeburger even recommended electric burglar alarms calling them an “almost a perfect guarantee of a thief’s apprehension, or, at least, that he will be frightened off before accomplishing robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Segregation Ordinance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers clearly saw how suburban growth at the periphery and disinvestment from the core drove Baltimore’s emerging vacant house problem. However, then and perhaps now, anxiety over high property taxes, worries over diminished property values and white supremacy largely defined the terms of the debate. Rather than challenge the enormous public subsidies for suburban growth or encourage more substantial investment in the maintenance of older city neighborhoods (by then occupied largely by recent immigrants and African Americans), the city instead fought vacancy by writing racism into local housing laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 1910, a member of the real estate firm of William Martien &amp;amp; Company who shared a growing “agitation over the number of vacant houses in the city,” asked the Baltimore Police board to undertake a “complete census of the number of houses, both vacant and occupied in the city.” With the release of the report, real estate agent James Cary Martien argued, “The number of vacant houses in the city is due both to the many dwellings being built in the suburbs and the dilapidated condition of many in Baltimore.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martien’s focus on housing supply and demand neglected to account for the intense concern that many Baltimoreans had with racial segregation – advancing the necessity of segregation on the principle of white supremacy and the economic logic of preserving property values. In the weeks that followed the publication of the report, a series of letters to the Sun expanded on Martien’s summary and tied vacancy closely to the perceived threat of “negro invasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation Ordinance, named for sponsor Council Samuel L. West who represented the northwestern neighborhood highlighted in the police report for the highest concentration of vacant houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new law was the first local ordinance in the country to enforce racial segregation in housing as it forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.” Each block was designated according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910 and the city police were tasked with enforcing the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, it was followed by several more  attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation. Often overlooked in this much-discussed chapter of Baltimore’s history of segregation, vacant housing played a critical role in stoking white fears and reinforcing a racialized perception of “blight” in the decades that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nancy-thurlow-mural---1811-mcculloh-street&quot;&gt;Nancy Thurlow Mural - 1811 McCulloh Street&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vacant lots have always been a problem that comes along with vacant housing. See Baltimore Sun, Aug 28, 1885:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Alleged Nuisances.–“A Resident” writes to The Sun calling attention to a nuisance, which, he says has existed the entire summer, occasioned by using the vacant lot between Lafayette ave. and Lanvale street, west of Fulton avenue, as a dumping ground for filth of various descriptions. The stench arising from the decomposition and fermentation during the late hot spell has been almost intolerable, particularly in the vicinity of the new culvert now building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do with a vacant lot?&lt;/strong&gt; That question drove the Beautiful Walls of Baltimore program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel selected ten winning designs and provided each artist with donated paint (Sears offered around 80 gallons), scaffolding, and a $1000 honorarium. By July 1974 nearly all ten of the murals were complete and Mayor William Donald Schaefer was pleased with how the colorful murals had brightened the streetscape, remarking on a bus tour of the murals in early October:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s a psychological thing. I don’t know if you’ve heard my lecture: If you go into a neighborhood and it’s dull and drab, you’re dull and drab. But if you go into a neighborhood and it’s bright and clean you feel better. You expect big things to be done. But it’s the little things that make the difference between living in a city and just existing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-of-bolton-streetarmory-plaza&quot;&gt;1200 Block of Bolton Street/Armory Plaza&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1909&lt;/strong&gt;: Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment Armory, favored the plan for the northward extension of Howard Street:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class, gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 1934&lt;/strong&gt;: Philander B. Briscoe, City Council member and member of the Mount Royal Protective Association:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“is seeking to have about twenty-five old houses in the neighborhood of the Fifth Regiment Armory torn down to complete the plaza scheme… “About one-half of them are vacant, some have the front nailed up, and fences sagging, and one doesn’t have to be an artist to see that the whole scheme of beautification is spoiled by them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 1939&lt;/strong&gt;: Rehabilitation on the 1200 block on Bolton Street used material from homes demolished for the construction of either Armory Plaza or McCulloh Homes [Additional research is required here]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Five years ago it had gone to pot. One or two families had clung persistently to their homes, but most of the owners had fled before the encroachment of undesirables who had begun to filter in. The razing of the 1100 block to make room for the Armory Plaza was a green light for speculators, who bought up property in the block right and left for occupancy by tenants forced out of the houses which were being torn down. Many of them moved in and proved to be so objectionable that an older resident, impoverished but respectable, immediately moved out in order to go to a better neighborhood. His house, left vacant, immediately was wrecked by vandals, who tore doors from their hinges and carried them off, pulled the gas and electric fixtures from the walls and ceilings and made off with part of the railings on the front steps.”
“To reestablish it and replace doors and door frames which had disappeared or were in bad condition the renovators doubled as camp followers of wrecking crews all over the city, picking up doors here, grillwork there, window sash some place else. Any place where it became known that old Baltimore houses were being torn down some resident or future resident of the 1200 block on Bolton street appeared, bent on salvage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;george-street---seton-hill&quot;&gt;404 George Street - Seton Hill&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1938&lt;/strong&gt;: Hillery Holton, died at age 79 at the house&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 1953&lt;/strong&gt;: Mrs. Tamathia Chandler, age 27 - lived at the house in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1963&lt;/strong&gt;: 410 George Street:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“the trim white house with blue door and window frames, was only a shell when John Sims bought it early this year. By his own skill and imagination he has since transformed the Nineteenth Century row building into a smart midtown pied-a-terre, and its back yard into a sophisticated city garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mr. Sim’s residence is one of a group that has emerged, fresh and neat, in the pastel-tinted restoration of old houses hidden in the byways of Seton Hill. In George Street… there are fourteen small brick and stucco row houses… Nearly all now have been or are being restored.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 1973&lt;/strong&gt;: Sun described “Baltimore’s near west side” as “one of local real estate’s disaster areas… This was the place where you literally could not give property away… The Seton Hill story is an object lesson in what happens if a city abandons centrally located, if secondary, land on its margins. Nothing but private money can get it going again and in Seton Hill’s case, nothing has.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes since the early 1960s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Renewal is spreading into back byways and even invading main thoroughfares like Druid Hill avenue… A typical three-story hulk about 1965, with or without windows or original interior trim, was yours for from $400 to $800… Now you might pay $3,500 to $5,000 for the same hulk. Partially improved it might be worth $18,000… Rents have gone from a month $10 to as much as $265.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1978&lt;/strong&gt;: Assessed at $3360, owned by Cornelius J. Bonner, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 1986&lt;/strong&gt;: John M. Heinz purchases the building&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2012&lt;/strong&gt;: Vacant building notice issued by Baltimore City, receivership&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 2014&lt;/strong&gt;: Auction failed, city stabilized building and plans to try again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is vacant property receivership? AKA possession or conservatorship&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A municipality or a qualified non-profit entity applies to the court to be appointed the &lt;strong&gt;receiver&lt;/strong&gt; of the property to restore the property to use. Once appointed, the receiver has physical control of the property, can borrow and spend money to rehabilitate the property and can place liens against the property for the amount spent. Once the property has been rehabilitated, the owner may be able to regain control by making the receiver whole, or the property is sold by the court or by the receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
