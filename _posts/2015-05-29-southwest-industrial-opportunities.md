_This tour was developed in partnership with Carol Ott, Housing Policy Watch and Andrew Cook, Baltimore City Planning Department._

# Program Announcement

Please join Baltimore City Department of Planning, Baltimore Heritage, and Housing Policy Watch for a bus tour, lunch, and discussion exploring opportunities for industrial redevelopment in Southwest Baltimore.

From Pigtown to Midtown Edmondson, neighborhoods in Southwest Baltimore have a proud legacy of industrial enterprise. In the middle of the 20th century, dozens of historic factories, warehouses and shops near Carroll Park employed thousands of West Baltimore residents. Unfortunately, long-term vacancy and abandonment has turned some of these historic structures from a boon into a burden. Sustaining existing industrial businesses and finding new uses for old industrial buildings can be a difficult challenge for neighborhood activists and property owners.

This two-hour bus tour explores a selection of historic industrial properties around southwest Baltimore. We’ll visit success stories like the C.L. McCoy Framing Company, vacant landmarks like the Eigenbrot Brewery, and highlight the potential for historic industrial buildings to help create new jobs and economic opportunities for Baltimore residents.

The tour will be followed by a one-hour lunch and discussion at Montgomery Park with guest speakers Bill Cole (Baltimore Development Corporation), Ilana Preuss (Recast City), and Kurt Sommer (Baltimore Integration Partnership). This program is open to everyone but we hope architects, developers, and neighborhood advocates will take advantage of this opportunity to learn more about an important preservation issue in southwest Baltimore and around the region.

# Introduction

> ”In 1912, The Baltimore Sun reported that Maryland had more manufacturing plants than all but 14 states. Manufacturing accounted for one-third of the jobs in Maryland just before World War II engulfed the country — and nearly half the state's jobs at the height of war production."

Mike Galiazzo, president of the Regional Manufacturing Institute of Maryland:

> ”Manufacturing was steppingstones to middle-class America… When we lose manufacturing, that just means nobody's knocking on the door to Bethlehem Steel, they're knocking on the door to Walmart."

*Baltimore Industrial Job Loss*

- **1950**: Over 34% of the city’s workforce was employed in manufacturing, over 75% of jobs in the region were located in the city.
- **2003**: Only 7.5% of city jobs are in manufacturing
- **1910**: Baltimore had 2,502 manufacturing establishments
- **2007**: Baltimore had only 512 "employer establishments" designated as "manufacturing."

Source: US Census Bureau

*U.S. Industrial Job Loss*

- **1980-2005**: During this period the nation as a whole lost about 4.5 million manufacturing jobs, or about 24 percent of its manufacturing employment.
- **2000-2010**: U.S. lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs, amounting to nearly one-third of its manufacturing employment.

*From ULI Building Reuse Report*

For decades, Baltimore, along with the state of Maryland, has been recognized as a national leader in historic preservation, adaptive use, and smart growth. Private developers, nonprofit organizations, and public agencies have creatively repurposed a remarkable number of formerly vacant Baltimore landmarks to serve new needs. Historic downtown office buildings are now boutique hotels and apartment buildings. Mills have become condominiums, offices, and galleries. Former industrial sites are repurposed as museums, shopping centers, and corporate headquarters. Local, state, and federal rehabilitation tax credits have made many of these projects financially feasible.

*Technical Barriers*

General technical barriers include a lack of on-site parking in many areas, limited access to safe and reliable transit alternatives, and environmental contamination issues. Lead paint presents a particularly thorny challenge for housing projects. Certain building types have layouts that are difficult to adapt to new uses, including industrial structures with deep floor plates, buildings with large interior volumes and small commercial buildings with upper floor offices or housing.

Industrial buildings. "Older industrial buildings offer the most potential. They typically have high ceilings and large floor plates, but these need to be in neighborhoods with market potential."

*Regulatory Barriers*

Codes were frequently cited as barriers to reuse, including building code requirements related to providing a secondary means of egress, as well as increasingly stringent energy codes and conflicts with historic preservation standards. Comments on zoning barriers focused on parking requirements and the need to adopt the new code provisions contained in Transform Baltimore, which would remove barriers to the reuse of small commercial structures in certain districts. The cumulative impact and sometimes conflicting nature of various reviews and regulations was also raised as a barrier.

# Carroll Park

## Montgomery Park (1925)

Built in 1925, the tall Montgomery Park Warehouse and Retail Store is one of nine monumental distribution centers built by the Montgomery Ward mail order company in cities around the United States.

- **1872:** Business founded by Aaron Montgomery Ward in Chicago, Illinois; sent catalogs (the "Wish Book") listing thousands of items from clothing to tractors
- **1925:** 8-story building, designed by in-house company Engineer of Construction, W. H. McCaully; served as the Atlantic Coast Headquarters in Baltimore thanks to the efforts of the city government and the Industrial Bureau of the Association of Commerce to attract new businesses; early example of a public economic development program.
- **1985**: Montgomery Ward closed
- **2000:** Montgomery Park has been adapted to a new use as offices. The new use also gave the building a new name but saved the sign replacing only two letters from the historic "Montgomery Ward" sign to preserve this icon on the southwest Baltimore skyline.
- **2003:** The development won the Environmental Protection Agency's 2003 Phoenix Award.

# Mt. Clare

## Mt. Clare Junction Shopping Center

In the mid-1980s, when the new Mount Clare Junction shopping center was built, it was designed in a style recalling the architecture of the old railroad buildings. Indeed, a huge steam locomotive was hauled inside the shopping arcade to remind visitors of the area's history. It stayed there until marketing consultants decided the engine was too overwhelming and part of the reason shoppers stayed away and the center lost merchants.

A Safeway supermarket had anchored the plaza when it was created as part of city-sponsored neighborhood redevelopment in the 1980s. Over the years, many major tenants – a RiteAid drugstore, a Blockbuster video store as well as Safeway – moved out.

# Additional Notes

Baltimore Economic Development Corporation (BEDCO), the economic development corporation in charge of industrial development. BEDCO was a quasi-public agency created in 1975 to manage the city’s $3 million industrial land-banking fund, which packaged land for manufacturing projects throughout the city. This fund had previously been run by the Baltimore Industrial Development Corporation, created in 1965.24Between 1976 and 1986, BEDCO acquired over 500 acres for industrial use, created six city-owned industrial parks (such as Fort Holland Industrial Park and the Seton Business Park), made improvements to older industrial parks and converted vacant factory buildings. BEDCO also ran a business retention program that primarily served large and medium businesses, along with other programs for small and minority businesses.

Kurt L. Schmoke was elected Mayor in 1987 and served until 1999. Early in his administration, Schmoke consolidated three agencies -- Charles Center-Inner Harbor Management, Market Center Development Corporation and Baltimore Economic Development Corporation -- into the Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC).
