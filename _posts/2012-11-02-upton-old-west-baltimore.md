# Introduction
 
## Early history of South Baltimore

- South Baltimore and Pigtown - "Open drains, great lots filled with high weeds, ashes and garbage accumulated in the alleyways"
- Between 1870 ad 1890, Baltimore population doubled from 250,000 to 500,000
- Baltimore's black middle-class sought better housing in northwest Baltimore, especially on Druid Hill Avenue
- B&O Railroad displaced 100 black families to expand the railroad yards
	 
## Expansion of Old West Baltimore

- "The Bottom" around Biddle Alley, bouned by Biddle Street, Argyle Avenue, Druid Hill Avenue, North Avenue, city's 17th ward
- By **1904**, ½ of Baltimore’s black population lived in the neighborhood
	  
# Eutaw Place

- Began as a gift by Henry Tiffany to the city accepted on **March 19, 1853**, with agreement for Tiffany to build “not less than seven houses of not less than twenty five feet front and three stories high.”
- Originally extended from Dolphin Street to the northern edge of Henry Tiffany’s property at Laurens Street, ordinance of **May 23, 1876** Eutaw extended to North Avenue.

Scharf:

> “Artistic gardening the highest character has exhausted its resources beautifying these squares and it may be said exaggeration that they form one of the most specimens of street parking to be found anywhere.”

- Railings around the Square removed in the **late 1870s**.
- Residents included Woodrow Wilson, **1883-1886**, while working on a Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins
	 
# Prince Hall Masonic Lodge

- Eutaw Place Temple built as a synagogue for the Temple Oheb Shalom congregation, designed by local architecture Joseph Evans Sperry borrowing elements from the Great Synagogue of Florence.
- Baltimore’s Prince Hall Lodge on Eutaw Street traces its origins to New England in 1784, where Prince Hall, the father of black Masonry in the United States, is credited with making it possible for African Americans to become Masons. In 1960, the Prince Hall Grand Lodge moved to this location on Eutaw Place, under the leadership of Samuel T. Daniels.

# Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson House – 1320 Eutaw Place

- Jackson grew up singing soprano in the choir of the Sharp Street Baptist Church
- Lived on Eutaw for 20 years
- She sponsored the City-Wide Young Peoples forum with her daughter Juanita in the leadership in the early **1930s**. The forum conducted a campaign to end racial segregation beginning with the grassroots "Buy Where You Can Work" campaign of 1931. Jackson and her daughter Juanita along with the forums' members encouraged African American residents of Baltimore to shop only at businesses where they could work, boycotting businesses with discriminatory hiring practices. The campaign's success led to similar protests in other cities around the country.
- At one forum gathering, Charles Hamilton Houston, informed the audience "we could sue Jim Crow out of Maryland." Subsequently, Carl Murphy of the Afro-American newspaper suggested that Lillie join forces with the NAACP. That was the beginning of her thirty-five year tenure with the NAACP, in a role as president of the Baltimore branch in **1935**, a position she held until retirement in **1970**. 1934 saw the beginning of Thurgood Marshall's employment with the Baltimore NAACP branch.
- Ultimately, her efforts built the Baltimore NAACP into the largest branch of the organization in the United States with a peak membership of 17,600
	  
# Douglass Memorial

- Designed by Thomas Balbirnie in the Greek Revival style as the Madison Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church in **1857**
- The “undercroft” was designed to seat 600 while the sanctuary seats 1,000.
- Douglass Memorial Community Church split from Bethel A.M.E. forming its own congregation in **1925**

Speaking about his involvement in the July 4, 1963 Gwynn Oak Park protests, Pastor Bascom stated:

> “I am the one who said all along I will not go to jail, but I will help others who go. But this morning I said to myself, I have nothing to lose but my chains. So if I do not preach at my pulpit Sunday morning, it might be the most eloquent sermon I ever preached.”

# 1800 McCoullough Street
 
The relationship between racial transition and racial segregation is clear beginning in **1910** when Baltimore became the first city in the United States to enact a law requiring racial segregation. In response to the attempt by George W. F. McMechen to move onto the 1800 block of McCulloh Street in 1910, Baltimore established a formal segregation ordinance which forbid black residents from moving to designated “white blocks” and white residents from moving to designated “colored blocks.”
 
On December 20, 1910, Baltimore Mayor John Barry Mahool signed into law the West Segregation  Ordinance, named for sponsor Councilman Samuel L. West, which identified each block in the city according to the racial identity of the majority of each block’s residents in 1910. While the West Segregation Ordinance was soon overturned as unconstitutional, its passage and the multiple subsequent attempts to enact a municipal law to enforce racial segregation reflected the deep resistance of white Baltimore residents to racial integration. As a consequence, the area of Old West Baltimore, including the neighborhoods of Harlem Park, Sandtown-Winchester, and Upton, became a predominantly African American community and together with a segregated area in East Baltimore some of the only areas open to African American residents.
 
George W. F. McMechen was born in Wheeling, West Virginia on October 29, 1871 to George and Mildred McMechen. Siblings included Mary L. and Ethel (Jones). In 1891 he enrolled in the first class of Morgan College, formerly the Centenary Biblical Institute. Graduating in 1895, he went on to study at Yale Law School, from which he received a degree in 1899.

# Western Female High School (1896- 1928), Booker T. Washington Middle School
- On **November 1, 1844**, Western High School officially opened its doors for the first time in Armitage Hall at 100 North Paca Street in Baltimore. In those two small rented rooms, Mr. Robert Kerr, principal and sole teacher, welcomed thirty-six young women. Before Western was established, there had been no opportunity for Baltimore girls to get an education beyond grammar school.
- Built **1896** designed by City Building Inspector, Annex completed in 1911

> “It is a well-known fact that as soon as a colored family moves into a block white families begin to move away. The owners of the vacated houses deciding they cannot get white tenants are forced to take such as they can get. To rent to negroes means a reduction of rentals and a deterioration in the value of property… But perhaps even stronger than any question of values and revenues is another reason waged against the change of this school. That is the proximity to the Western Female High School, which is only two blocks distant. Every street leading to the high school would be filled morning and evening with throngs of negroes of both sexes and all ages up, perhaps, to 20 years. Morning and evening the young ladies attending the high school would encounter these negroes and it is not fair nor public spirited of the School Board to subject them to that. There is a growing disposition among negro men and boys all over the land to be unmannerly, insolent and violent to white women.”

- By **1928**, renovated school houses Coppin Normal School, moved from a black school at Mount and Saratoga, Colored Junior High School, Headquarters of the black public schools, directed by Francis
M. Wood

**Francis M. Woods**

Born Barren County, Kentucky, 1878, Francis Wood was also president of the Kentucky Negro Educational Association (KNEA) for 10 years and of the Kentucky Negro Industrial Institute (now Kentucky State University) from May 1923 to June 1924. In 1925 he became supervisor and later director of the Baltimore Colored Schools. In 1934 he was elected president of the National Association of Teachers in Colored Schools and established a permanent office in Washington, D.C.

# Royal Theater
- The Royal Theatre, which first opened in **1922** as the black-owned Douglass Theatre, was the most famous theater along West Baltimore City's Pennsylvania Avenue, one of a circuit of five such theaters for black entertainment in big cities - including the Apollo in Harlem, the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., the Regal Theatre in Chicago, and the Earl Theater in Philadelphia.
- All of the biggest stars in black entertainment, including those in jazz and blues, performed at the Royal. Ethel Waters debuted there, as did Pearl Bailey, who sang in a chorus line. Louis Armstrong and Fats Waller worked as accompanists. Singer Louis Jordan, Duke Ellington, The Tympany Five, Etta James, Nat King Cole, The Platters, The Temptations, and The Supremes, as well as a 40-piece, all- female band touring with Count Basie called the Sweethearts of Rhythm, were all performers at the Royal.
- In **1971**, the Royal Theater was demolished.
- The Royal Theater Marquis Monument was said to be phase one of an ongoing series of projects that the Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Collaborative (PARC) would lead. PARC and the Pennsylvania Avenue Committee worked closely with the Mayor's Office, the Upton Planning Committee, and 14 community groups over seven years to erect the Royal Theater Monument in **2004**.
	 
# Public School 103
_Division Street between Lanvale and Lafayette_
 
- Built in **1877** and possessing a high degree of integrity, P.S. 103 was for many years the most highly regarded elementary school for African American children in Baltimore. Thurgood Marshall (1908- 1993) attended the school from 1914-1920, his first six years of public school education
- Later named for Henry Highland Garnet School
- Twelve makeshift classrooms, rooms separated by sliding doors when opened turned two or three classrooms into a auditorium
	 
In **1913**, Baltimore school commissioner Richard Biggs remarked:

> “Stop at once the so-called high education that unfits Negroes for the lives that they are to lead and which makes them desire things they will never be able to reach.”
 
- Academic year for black children 1 month shorter than the year for whites, with the expectation that children would find work, with many leaving school every spring to pick strawberries
- Sat in the first row, as his classmate Agnes Peterson later recalled, “he was always playing, and so they had to keep right on top of him.”
	- When he began attending PS 103 at age 6, his family lived with his Uncle Fearless Mentor or Uncle Fee, Fearless at 1632 Division Street, worked as the personal attendant to the president of the B&O Railroad, wearing a suit and a bowtie to work daily, and home every afternoon to talk with Thurgood and his brother Aubrey, working next door at a Jewish owned grocery
	- Originally named Thoroughgood
- Later attended Douglass High School

# Sharp Street Church
Dolphin & Etting Street
 
- Sharp Street Church was established in **1787** (?) as the first African American Methodist congregation in Baltimore City, now regarded as the Mother Church of black Methodism.
- In **1797**, blacks gathered at 112-116 Sharp Street, where the Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery had opened the Baltimore African Academy, the city's first prominent day school for blacks. The Society later abandoned this project and sold the lot and building in 1802 to the black congregation, which then built a church on the property, first building occupied by the congregation.
- In **1846**, the church hosted the first regional conference for black methodists, which resulted in the first appointment of black pastors and the creation of a black governing board. From 1867 until 1872, the Centenary Biblical Institute (now Morgan State University) held classes there.
- Following its congregation into northwest Baltimore, the church erected the present building designed by Alphonsus Bieler in 1898. Lived at 1021 McCulloh, also designed church for Macedonian Baptist on Saratoga at Vincent
- In **1921**, Arthur M. Segoin, a black architect, designed the adjacent Community House, the first of its kind in Baltimore.
- Founded Mt. Auburn Cemetery, one of the few early African American cemeteries in Baltimore, and where hundreds of prominent African Americans are buried including Dr. Lillie Carroll Jackson, William A. Hawkins, and John H. Murphy, founder of The Afro-American Newspapers.
- Funeral for Lillie Carrol Jackson, **July 1975** - 1,200 people attended Dr. Jackson funeral, another 300 stood outside, included Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall, Supereme Court Justice, Rep. Parren Mitchell

# Union Baptist Church
1211 Druid Hill Avenue
 
- Founded in **1852**, the church has an extremely rich history in the civil rights movement, starting in **1892** with its withdrawal from the Maryland Baptist Union Association because of its discrimination. In **1897**, Rev. Dr. Harvey Johnson, Union Baptist Church's 5th Pastor, was the minister who organized the Colored Baptist Convention. Johnson, a friend of W.E.B. DuBois, established the Niagara Movement, which was a prototype for the NAACP. He also filed a lawsuit to gain equal pay for black teachers and to make it possible for black lawyers to practice in the state of Maryland. The planning meetings preceding the Niagara Movement were at Union Baptist Church. Dr. Johnson also filed a lawsuit and won the first case in the U.S. striking down the identification of Negroes as cargo in interstate commerce. During this time thirteen churches were established from Union's congregation, five of which are still in existence today.
- Union Baptist Church was energized by the **1960s** under Dr. Vernon Dobson, church became a meeting place for civil rights activities including Baltimore’s participation in the 1963 March on Washington. Parren Mitchell, a leading civil rights leader and head of Johnson’s Model Cities Program began to work with Rev. Dobson and Parren Mitchell began to steer funds to Union Baptist.
- On **October 3, 2010**, Union Baptist Church's main sanctuary building was dedicated for being placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States National Parks Service. This honor was bestowed because of the significance of Rev. Dr. Harvey Johnson and the architect of the main sanctuary, Mr. William J. Beardsley.

# Bethel AME Church
Druid Hill Avenue at Lanvale Street
 
- “Old Bethel held its ground longer than the rest,” declared Mr. James P. Matthews, former reporter for the Baltimore American at the dedication, reflecting on the northwest move of black churches
- The Bethel African Methodist Episcopal congregatoin is the oldest independent black institution in Baltimore. Its origins date back to the late 18th century, when blacks (attending Lovely Lane Meeting House) withdrew from the parent Methodist Church in protest against racially segregated seating and lack of representation in church hierarchy.
- To exercise control over their own spiritual affairs, the dissenting blacks formed a "Free African Society," congregating for prayers and meetings in private homes. They soon adopted the name "Bethel," (a Hebrew word meaning house of God), and in **1817**, acquired their first church building, the old German Lutheran Churhc on Fish Street (now Saratoga).
- Bethel's first pastor was Daniel Coker, an eminent orator and educator who later became the first recognized missionary of the Church when he joined the colonization party that went to Liberia in 1820. In 1816 an organizing conference in Philadelphia formally established the national independent African Methodist Episcopal Church. Coker was elected the first bishop; he declined the post, however, and Richard Allen was appointed the following day. Fourteen of the former pastors of Bethel have gone on to become bishops of the Church. Bethel purchased the St. Peters Protestant Church on November 20, 1910 for $90,000 with $20,000 put down in cash. The dedication service was held January 8, 1911. By moving to Druid Hill Avenue and Lanvale Street, it joined two other historic black congregations in the neighborhood: Union Baptist and Sharp Street Memorial.
- In **1910** Bethel moved to this church, originally constructed in 1868 for St. Peter's Protestant Episcopal Church. It was one of several churches designed in "Norman Gothic" style by the Baltimore architects N.H. Hutton and John Murdoch.
- In **1882**, Bethel member and Sunday school teacher John M. Murphy, Sr. purchased the Afro- American Newspaper. He turned the newspaper into a well respected weekly, and it was the most read black newspaper in the middle Atlantic State region. His father was choir director at Bethel for many years and is wife Martha Murphy was one of the co-founders of the first black YWCA in Baltimore in **1896**.

# McCulloh Homes

- The Housing Authority of Baltimore City had been formed a few years before on **December 13, 1937** when the Baltimore City Council passed legislation to establish it shortly after the creation of the U.S. Housing Authority with the passage of the Wagner-Steagall Act. Mayor Howard Jackson appointed five men to the authority’s board of commissioners. And although the City Council rejected a resolution calling for the appointment of one African American to the commission, the mayor chose  a member of one of Baltimore’s most prominent African American families in naming George Murphy, a retired school principal and vice chairman of the Urban League. The housing authority’s first executive director was Clarence W. Perkins, a former state senator and executive director of the Maryland Emergency Housing and Park Commission.
- More than 2,500 black people applied for 434 apartments in McCulloh Homes

# Fifth Regiment Armory

- Built in **1901**, the Fifth Regiment Armory is a historic National Guard armory with a 200 foot by 300 foot drill hall, a mezzanine or "balcony" level, and a newer second level (reconstructed in 1933 after a fire) housing the trussed steel drill hall roof.
- Designed by Wyatt & Nolting, the partnership of James Bosley Noel Wyatt and William G. Nolting, also designed the Baltimore City Courthouse and the Garrett Building on Redwood Street Downtown.

In **1906**, Colonel C. Baker Clotworthy, commander of the Fifth Regiment:

> “I would be deeply interested in this improvement because it means so much more than simply tearing down some houses and opening a street. Everyone in the city is familiar with the steady decrease which has taken place in the value of property in this neighborhood for the last 20 years.
> All about Richmond Market, and extending north, there are hundreds of undesirable houses and, in many cases, huts. This sore is spreading rapidly. A great many negroes, not of the best class,  gradually tenant the houses on the edge of this district and immediately the white people move from the block invaded. If this continues no one knows where it will stop."

- In the Mt. Royal area, a group of 300 northwest Baltimore residents (led by the president of the Baltimore Bar Library and the neighborhood's City Council representative, among others) responded to the changes on Bolton Street by signing racial covenants barring the sale or lease of their properties to African Americans.
- In the **1920s**, the Mount Royal Protective Association boasted of their Efforts to secure and enforce racial covenants from local property owners, noting the group's "greatest achievement... has been the subjecting of the property in its area to a restriction for white occupancy only." 
	 
# State Center

- Dr. Robert L. Jackson, only black member of the City Planning Commission, opposed the Armory site, noting that it would force 950 black families to move
- Richard L. Steiner, Director of BURHA figured room for 370 families, would not state how many available for black renters, "That's in the hands of the redeveloper." 
- In **1953**, Mt. Royal Improvement Association rallied over 200 people to support the location, calling it "best means of salvaging a run down area."
- NAACP, represented by W.A.C. Hughes opposed the development, Hughes office located there and his mother owned property in the area. HUghes volunteered with the NAACP as a lawyer from the 1930s through his death in 1966, Morgan State stadium named after him
