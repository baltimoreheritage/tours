### Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. - Double Statue (1987)

**A. Lloyd Lillie, Jr.**: Born 1932, award-winning sculptor; received a diploma from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and also studied at Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture, the Corcoran School of Art, and the Accademia di Belle Arti, Florence.

> A double portrait of former Baltimore mayor, Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., a driving force behind the downtown revitalization of Charles Center. One portrait depicts D'Alesandro casually standing by the side of the plaza looking out over Charles Center. His proper right hand rests on the railing of the plaza and his proper left hand rests on his left trouser pocket. A few feet away, another portrait depicts him relaxing on a park bench with his arms stretched out over the back of the bench. His legs are crossed and he looks over to his proper left.

Thomas D'Alesandro died in 1987:

> As mayor from 1947 to 1959, D'Alesandro presided over a period of vast physical improvements in Baltimore. An airport was opened outside the city during his tenure, and major league baseball returned to Baltimore.
> In 1958, he won voter approval for the financing of the Charles Center urban renewal project, launching the rejuvenation that remade much of the heart of his beloved city. [Source.](http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-29/news/mn-1349_1_thomas-d-alesandro-jr)


### About Charles Center

- **1954 **: Committee for Downtown organized to promote a 1000-acre master plan for stopping the commercial decline of downtown/central Baltimore.
- **1955**: Greater Baltimore Committee, led by banker and developer [James W. Rouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Rouse "James W. Rouse"), joined the effort. Dissatisfied with the slow pace of public planning, GBC formed an in-house planning team, the Planning Council, headed by nationally-known planner David Wallace from Philadelphia.

**David Wallace:** In Philadelphia, PA in 1953, under Mayor Joseph S. Clark, David Wallace led a citywide urban redevelopment evaluation that resulted in the Central Urban Renewal Area (CURA) Report. The report established a new strategy for overall redevelopment that targeted catalytic actions to strengthen communities and downtown. CURA became a model for Baltimore, MD.

- **March 1958:** Presented a plan to Mayor & City Council calling for office buildings, commercial space, hotels, a theatre, underground parking, etc. Unusual in for incorporating existing structures (not a "clean-slate" design), across a 33 acre site.  Includes three public plazas designed by [RTKL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTKL "RTKL"), connected by walkways and pedestrian bridges. Plan formed the basis of a $25 million bond issue that year. Eventually spent $40 million public funding, $145 million private investment.
- GBC established an **Architectural Review Board **: Deans from three of the most prominent architectural schools in the U.S. (Harvard, MIT and University of Pennsylvania) who judged the plans for each parcel of land before development.

Public benefits: _increase in employment_ help the city's economy; _increase in tax base_ will mean more city resources to meet the needs of the poor. Property development scheme of direct benefit to coporate and finance capital: new downtown employment in skilled or high-paying jobs went to suburban residents, jobs created for city residents are temporary construction or low-paying service sector.[^1]

Declaring Charles Center the "New Heart of Baltimore," Jane Jacobs called the project an:

> …attempt to stimulate a rebuilding use which is at fundamental odds with previous use or the surroundings of the project. The site is in the very heart of downtown, not on its fringes, and it is to be re-used for precisely the things that belong in the heart of downtown.

**September 1970:** First City Fair staged at Charles Center
> A pall hung over many city leaders when several of them, including housing commissioner Robert Embry, suggested a city fair at its new Charles Center to celebrate its neighborhoods, ethnic customs, talents and institutional strength.  On the eve of the first fair, fearing that it would set up a riot-prone situation and under pressure from conservatives, D'Alesandro almost canceled it.  However, the fair was held and became an annual event, drawing over a million visitors. 

## Charles Plaza & Center Plaza (1958, 2007)

The 1958 Charles Center promotional report stated:
> “Here, open space will be used, loved and economically successful because it will be full of pleasant things: fountains, sculpture, flowers, umbrellas, flags, and trees. The open space will be, in its own way, as concentrated as the city around it.”

George Kostritsky of RTKL envisioned an urban landscape of light, sculpture, and water for Charles, Center, and Hopkins plazas. These three plazas, located on the interior of the two superblocks, were to be linked through a series of elevated walkways, escalators and skywalks in order to overcome the problem of the site’s steep topography (a 68-foot drop in grade from the northern boundary of the site to the southern boundary) and to create a series of “pedestrian islands.” Though futuristic in appearance, this circulation system was a typical component of urban design of the 1950s and 60s and was often promoted as a means of separating pedestrians from the automobile traffic. At Charles Center, the exterior circulation system was also intended to provide a venue for extensive retail activity.[^2]

### One Charles Center (1962)
