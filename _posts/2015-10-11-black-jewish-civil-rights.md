# 1: Overview

## 1.1: What is this tour about?

This tour is about understanding how relationships between Baltimore’s black and Jewish residents shaped the Civil Rights movement and the historic places of northwest Baltimore. Major themes and concepts include:

- How has housing segregation and employment discrimination shaped the experience of black and Jewish people in Baltimore? How have these factors shaped the development of neighborhoods like Madison Park, Reservoir Hill, Park Circle and Park Heights?
- How were Jewish people in Baltimore involved with the Civil Rights movement? Where did this involvement take place and why?
- How did Jewish people engage with residents of Baltimore’s historically black neighborhoods?

## 1.2: Tour Guide Tips

- Meet the tour group in front of the Howard P. Rawlings Conservatory.
- This tour is mostly downhill when riding southeast and uphill when riding northwest.
- For bike tours, we suggested giving verbal turn by turn directions before setting off at each stop.

## 1.3: About these notes

Key concepts in each section of the notes have been **marked in bold**. Large headings separate stops or sections of the tour. We plan to update with information on the estimated amount of time we plan to spend at each stop. Smaller headings separate major concepts within the narrative. These notes are not intended to be read verbatim but are instead meant to inform and guide a tour leader as they respond to the group of participants.

These notes were prepared by Eli Pousson for a bicycle tour on 2015 October 11. Sites of interest on the tour and vicinity are available as a GeoJSON file that we are planning to turn into an interactive map. Of related interest is our [broader map of Civil Rights associated sites](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/baltimore-civil-rights-heritage/map/).

# 2: Welcome & Introduction

## 2.1: Why did Jewish people live in northwest Baltimore?

- **1825**: Around 150 Jews lived in Baltimore (according to Solomon Etting) most living in Oldtown and South Baltimore near the harbor.
- **1860s**: Increasing mobility led members of the Jewish community to move away from the city center to Reservoir Hill and Madison Park/Eutaw Place, near Druid Hill Park. This trend separated more prosperous "uptown" Jews of German descent and less prosperous "downtown" Jews, recent immigrants from Eastern Europe.
- **1901**: A group of wealthy Jews, mostly German descent, established the **Suburban Club** in the Park Heights corridor between Druid Ridge Cemetery and the northwestern city line

Built for $200,000, the **Suburban Club** required substantial dues and that members contribute a certain amount of money annually to Jewish charities.

- **1910s-40s**: Pattern of Jewish migration was complex; Liberty Road, Reisterstown Road, and Park Heights Avenue all major corridors. Development Expansion along the Park Heights corridor took place in several stages in the early 20th century. Forest Park and Park Heights both attracted many middle-class Jewish homebuyers were. Neighborhoods closer to Druid Hill Park are largely rowhouse districts; close the city line or beyond are largely detached homes.

**Deed restrictions and racial covenants** excluded both Jewish and African American Baltimoreans from purchasing property in neighborhoods developed by the Roland Park Company and many others.

## 2.2: How did African Americans see Jews? How did Jews see African Americans?

- **1860s**: **Dr. David Einhorn**, Baltimore rabbi, preached abolitionism in pro-slavery Baltimore, made his journal _Sinai_ an organ for the movement, left Baltimore for Philadelphia to avoid mob violence
- **1900**: Before WWI, Baltimore had proportionally the largest Jewish population of any Southern city; larger black population than any northern city
- **1909**: In New York, blacks and Jews cooperated in founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
- **1930s-40s**: Black and white lawyers worked on civil rights lawsuits throughout the South, honing the skills and arguments men such as Thurgood Marshall would put to use in the landmark cases of the 1950's, and into the 1960’s.
- **1960s**:  Rise of black power in the 60's and differences among blacks and Jews over affirmative action as key developments that drove a wedge into the coalition.

> During the Civil Rights Movement, Jewish activists represented a disproportionate number of whites involved in the struggle. Jews made up half of the young people who participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964. Leaders of the Reform Movement were arrested with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in St. Augustine, Florida, in 1964 after a challenge to racial segregation in public accommodations. Most famously, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marched arm-in-arm with Dr. King in his 1965 March on Selma.
> —[Jews and the Civil Rights Movement](http://www.rac.org/jews-and-civil-rights-movement)

> ”I would say that [...] the Jews are white people with all the white people's psychology and prejudices when it comes to dealing with Negroes."
> — Morgan State University President  [?] talking about Baltimore.

In early 1900s:

> Some labor activists compared Jewish industrial workers to new American slaves who "took [the] place of the Negroes who with great effort had won their freedom from slavery." [...] The Arbeiter Setung attacked employers in Baltimore for demanding character references from previous bosses. "Are we in dark Asiatic Russia or in free America?" inquired the reporter.[^1]

# 3: Druid Hill Park

## 3.1: How did Druid Hill Park develop?

- **1860**: Druid Hill Park established on the former country estate of Lloyd Rogers. Later developed with elaborate gardens, lakes, trails & sculptures & now contains the Maryland Zoo.

## 3.2: Druid Hill Park Tennis Courts

> Discrimination against the Negro people means discrimination against Jews, Catholics and all minorities. Segregation is a policy used to divide people and results in inferior living conditions and recreational facilities for all.
> —Stanley Askin, July 1948

- **1943 July 17**: Dallas F. Nicholas contacts Baltimore Board of Recreation and Parks for all-black Baltimore Tennis Club calling for an end to the segregation of courts
- **1948**: Young Progressives of Maryland, a political group of college-aged men and women in Baltimore, joined with the black Baltimore Tennis Club to stage a protest of Druid Hill Park's segregated tennis facilities, cries of communism were immediate:

> The interracial game was planned and advertised, but stopped by police before any actual play could take place. All of the players were arrested, along with several spectators who were heard to yell, "This is Nazi Germany! Why can't they play? They're 33 American citizens!" As they were arrested, the protestors began singing songs like "America, the Beautiful," "My Country 'Tis of Thee," and the Negro National Anthem.

**Stanley Askin** was a twice-wounded leader of a Ranger battalion in the D-Day landing at Normandy, later said:

> “Segregation, we reasoned, was indefensible. Many of those who agreed with us were Jewish. Early on we had learned that if you scratch a racist, you often uncover an anti-Semite."

Historian Deb Weiner writes:

>  In July 1948 young Jewish leftists took part in an early civil rights protest featuring the nonviolent civil disobedience that would soon come to characterize the movement. The interracial Young Progressives of Maryland (a branch of the Progressive Party) joined with the all-black Baltimore Tennis Club to hold an interracial tennis match at segregated Druid Hill Park in front of an enthusiastic, racially mixed crowd of supporters. When police insisted that the players quit the clay courts, “the contestants sat or lay down on the ground and refused to move,” reported the Sun. “Most were lifted bodily and placed in patrol wagons.” About thirteen blacks and ten whites were arrested, at least eight Jewish. Most of the charges were dropped though some of the organizers were convicted of conspiracy and received suspended sentences, including tennis player Stanley Askin and state Progressive Party chair Harold Buchman. (Both would soon be targeted by HUAC for their political activities; Askin was blacklisted from his radio career and never quite recovered. Buchman would reemerge as an activist attorney whose clients included the Catonsville Nine.)

## 3.3: Pool No. 2

- **1921**: “Pool No. 2” built in to meet the recreational and competitive swimming needs of all of Baltimore’s African Americans.

Pool No. 2 measured just 100’ x 105’ (half the size of whites-only Pool No. 1), but proved so popular that the swimmers had to be admitted in shifts. Pool No. 1, connected directly to the reservoir, supplied swimmers with unfiltered water; Pool No. 2 had filters installed to “de-negroize” the water, ensure the “safety” of the rest of the city.

> ”Inadvertently, this offensive policy resulted in a better experience for African-Americans. Scott succinctly states, “What was seen as a way of restraining someone only made them stronger.”

|        | Population (1920)    | Public Pools      | People/pool
|-------------|---------------|-----------|-----------
| White     | 618,695       | 6 pools | 103,116
| Black    |  115,129       | 1 pool | 115,129
| Total     |   733,824       | 7 pools | 104,832

- **1953**: when an African-American boy accidentally drowned while swimming with friends in the Patapsco River. He lived near Clifton Park but was not allowed to swim in the park’s whites-only pool. For this reason it was thought that he chose to swim in the dangerous river feeding Baltimore Harbor’s Middle Branch. As a result, the NAACP pushed for all Baltimore municipal pools to be opened to all races. When the Parks Board refused, the NAACP filed a lawsuit, which they eventually won on appeal.
- **1956 June 23**: Baltimore pools open for the summer on a non-segregated basis; over 100 African-Americans reportedly braved the waters in Pool No. 1; only one white person swam in Pool. No. 2.
- **1957**: Pool No. 2 is closed in an “effort to eliminate all vestiges of the city’s former “separate but equal” swimming infrastructure.”
- **1999**: Memorial Pool created by Baltimore artist Joyce J. Scott, who asked, “How do we make this area useful and beautiful, and harken back to the pool era?”

**Preservation Issue**: “In addition to the architectural framing devices and aquatic symbolism, the original installation included abstract, colorful painted designs on the pavement around the pool that have since faded from the concrete surface and disappeared due to time and weather.”

# 4: Madison Park and Eutaw Place

## 4.1: How did Eutaw Place develop in the late 1800s? How did the area become African American in the 1920s-30s?

_Source: “Front Stoops in the 50’s” (2013), Michael Olesker._

**What was the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC)?**

The FEPC was established to enforce Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802 banning:

> “discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin.”

Clarence worked at the FEPC from 1942 until 1946 when the FEPC was dissolved, then joined the staff of the NAACP. “Jewish groups were among the FEPC's earliest supporters, a number of FEPC staff members were Jews; Jewish organizations forwarded complaints to the FEPC and were among the prime initiators of FEPC efforts to remove religious questions from employment applications and personnel and security investigations of applicants.” [Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn4v5HoKM5cC&lpg=PR147&ots=stn4JOye6f&dq=clarence%20mitchell%20jewish&pg=PR144#v=onepage&q=clarence%20mitchell%20jewish&f=false)

**1943 March**: Mitchell wrote to Theodore A. Jones, "Material to be submitted for War Manpower Commission report”:

> "There has been some improvement in the over-all employment of minority groups in industry but there is still a [widespread] tendency to confine Negros to unskilled jobs and to exclude altogether [Negro women and] persons who are Jewish or aliens.”

**How did the Jewish experience in America and Europe influence the Civil Rights struggle? How did Jews support the Civil Rights movement?**

During WWII, the  _Afro American_ and other voices advocated against discrimination in Baltimore be comparing it to fascism in Europe. Tactic was used in the Orchids & Onions campaign to stop discrimination against black shoppers at downtown department stores. Onions included the May Company, Stewart's Department Store, and Hutzler’s.

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in  Letter from a Birmingham Jail (1963) echoes Juanita Jackson Mitchell's argument in _State v. Bell_  (1960) reflects on important parallels between Jewish and African American struggle:

> We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was "legal" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was "illegal." It was "illegal" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany.’[^2]

**Joseph L. Rauh Jr.,** a Jewish lawyer from Washington, DC, who worked 40 years for the NAACP, worked closely with Clarence Mitchell. Rauh recalled Senator Harry Byrd Sr. of Virginia railing on the Senate floor railing against a civil rights bill on which  Rauh and Clarence Mitchell Sr., worked:

> Clarence and I were in the gallery and Byrd suddenly gestured to us as he spoke from the Senate floor and said: 'There they are. The Golddust Twins,' '' he recalled. ''It was the happiest moment of my life.'' —[NYT, 1988](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/30/us/jews-and-blacks-recall-the-decades-of-partnership.html)

See Wikipedia on [The Gold Dust Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Dust_Twins)

**Rabbi Edward Israel**, a “social justice” (almost a socialist) rabbi at Har Sinai in the 1920s, one of the only Jewish leaders at the time who called for department stores to desegregate (note that Albert Hutzler was a congregant and his family among the founders). Israel was very involved in black-white cooperation efforts through the Citywide Young People’s Forum.

Famously wrote an article for _The Crisis_ about anti-semitism he encountered at the Young People’s Forum, followed by a response from Lillie Mae Jackson:

> —\_Afro-American [Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=BBzbA3HwmbkC&lpg=PA841&dq=black%20jewish%20baltimore%20jazz&pg=PA241#v=onepage&q=baltimore&f=false)

## 4.7: Walter Sondheim Residence
_1621 Bolton Street_

**1908 July 25**: Walter Sondheim, Jr. born in Baltimore, grows up at 1621 Bolton Street. Later quoted in the _Sun_:

> […] Mr. Sondheim has not escaped feeling the effects of bigotry in his own life, but "I can't say in any way that it was ever really disabling. I don't think that you can grow up in our society and not be conscious of the fact that you're Jewish. There was much more bigotry when I grew up than there is now. For example in Baltimore I remember when Mrs. Sondheim and I were married in 1934, when we were looking for an apartment she came home shocked one night because she had found someplace that she wanted and was told she could not rent it because we were Jews. And I have felt strongly about some of the club discrimination in Baltimore, particularly the non-social clubs. But I think the important things in this area have changed, and it's nice to have lived in a time when this has happened.

Sondheim spent 41 years working for Hochshild Kohn, ending as senior vice president and treasurer.

**1954**: A cross was burned on the lawn of Walter Sondheim at his Alto Road home in Windsor Hills (later recalled as a "puny little cross").
**1957**: Walter Sondheim leaves the school board to take a position as the first head of the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Commission

Sondheim on the success of urban renewal:

> "I think some of the principal successes were some of the things we learned by making mistakes. And one of the biggest things we learned was that you have to avoid the tendency to know what's good for people. I think it's a lesson we learned fairly quickly in residential areas, and Harlem Park is the best example. We went in and started to decide what ought to be done in the Harlem Park area, and we soon learned that you don't do it that way. People want to have something to say about their own fortunes and their own futures.”[^6]

In his later years, **Albert Hutzler** lived at the **Esplanade**; **Max Hoschild**, owner/president of the Hoschild-Kohn Department Store that stood next to Hutzler’s store on Howard Street, lived at the **Emersonian**.

** Civil Rights and Jewish-owned Department Stores**

**1938**: After meeting with department store owners, Walter White of the NAACP lamented the situation, where the nine largest department stores, seven owned by Jews refused African American customers:

> "Justify it on the ground that they might lose some white trade if they stopped discriminating against Negroes. One of the leading Jewish department store heads even became offended because I very mildly pointed out the parallel between what Hitler was doing to Jews in Germany and what Jewish and Gentile merchants were doing to another minority group right here in the United States."

**1939 January**: AJC published a report titled "The Truth About Baltimore”:

> ”Objectively, there are Jewish owned stores that accept Negro customers and Christian owned stores that do no. However, there can be no doubt that most of the blame for the situation is placed on the Jews.”

> NCJW, in Baltimore, while the AJC and ADL defended the racist practices of Jewish store owners, Jewish women organized petition drives as shoppers to urge a change of policy[^7] (c. 1956?)
